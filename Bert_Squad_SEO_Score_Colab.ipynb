Seward  Frederick Seward  Augustus Seward  Fanny Seward  George F. Robinson  Emerick Hansell  Perpetrators John Wilkes Booth and co-conspirators Motive Revenge for the Confederate States  Abraham Lincoln , the 16th President of the United States , was assassinated by well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am, in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated, [4] and Lincoln's funeral and burial marked an extended period of national mourning. Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government .\n",
            "Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .\n",
            "Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.

John Wilkes Booth, born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right.\n",
            "He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore . [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the North into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–4 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as \"Lewis Paine\"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House. [11] : 325–6 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: \"What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!\" [7] : 174, 437n.41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel ; [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–6, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army. On April 9 the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to the Commanding General of the United States Army  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House .  Confederate President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. But Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes Booth greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: \"John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!\" [16] [17] On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's speech at the White House in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks; [18] Booth said\n",
            "\"That means nigger citizenship  ... That is the last speech he will ever give.\" Enraged, Booth urged Lewis Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed and/or because he considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is not exactly known. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally make an attempt on the President's life. However, Booth said to David Herold, \"By God, I'll put him through.\" [19] [8] : 91   Lincoln's premonitions  According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:  I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. \"Who is dead in the White House?\" I demanded of one of the soldiers, \"The President,\" was his answer; \"he was killed by an assassin.\" [20]   However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that \"In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.\" [21] [22] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [21]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [23] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a \"singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore\", and that he'd had the same dream before \"nearly every great and important event of the War\" such as the victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [24]   Preparations   Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865)  On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well, but that he was \"in haste\". In his diary, he wrote that \"Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done\". [13] : 728 [23] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–9 He went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19    Ford's Theatre  The conspirators met for the final time at 7  p.m. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. John Wilkes Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. It is likely he reasonably (but ultimately, incorrectly) assumed that the entrance of the Presidential Box would be guarded and that he would be the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Deringer , and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre . They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212   Assassination of Lincoln   Lincoln's box  Lincoln arrives at the theater  Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [25] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point Mary Lincoln developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [27] One of Lincoln's bodyguards, William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [28] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , \"I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay\" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted and the orchestra played \" Hail to the Chief \" as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [29] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [30] [31]    Booth's Philadelphia Deringer  The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, \"Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft \" – was delivered instead as, \"The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!\" [32] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and \"seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment.\" [33]  At one point Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" Lincoln replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". [12] : 39 In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [34]   Booth shoots Lincoln   This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot.  With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the president's box. [35] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's footman and coachman. It is unclear whether he returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [36] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth, and the fact that Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box would indicate he was expecting a guard. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [37]   About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the \"Pres\" box was and I heard a man say, \"There's Booth\" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in.  Once through this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain. [38] [39] : 173    Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): \"At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth.\"  Booth knew the play by heart, and waited to time his shot with the laughter at one of the best lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : \"Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\". Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. [40] : 96  Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer . [2] The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [43] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [45] [46] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like \"Freedom!\" [47]   Booth escapes   Booth's dagger  Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [48] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head, and yelled something to the audience.\n",
            "While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! (\"Thus always to tyrants\") either from the box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [49] [50] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either \"The South is avenged!\", [12] : 48 \"Revenge for the South!\", or \"The South shall be free!\" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: \"I have done it!\") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights, and pursued Booth across the stage. [48] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of \"Stop that man!\" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth ran across the stage and exited through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [51] [52] Booth had left a horse waiting outside in the alleyway.  As he leapt into the saddle Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs [d] (the man holding the horse) away, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [53] [54] [55] [1]   Death of Lincoln   Surgeon Charles Leale  Charles Leale , a young Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut. [8] : 120  Leale entered the box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [42] as Mary held him and sobbed: \"His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous .\" [56] [57] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted from the stage into the box. After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to dislodge a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–2 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78    Skull fragments and probe used.  Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [58] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [59] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed. [8] : 123–4    Lincoln's deathbed [e]  More physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [61] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, \"to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend.\" [8] : 14 [62]  Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived sometime after midnight but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mary Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and his confederates. [8] : 127–8 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [61]    The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [f]  Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [63]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started \"breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.\" [64] [65] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became \"perfectly natural\" [64] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [66] Shortly before 7  a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [67] and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" [68]  Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [69] [70] In his last moments Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [71] Field wrote there was \"no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing\". [64] [65] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\". [72] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either \"Now he belongs to the ages\" or \"Now he belongs to the angels.\" [8] : 134 [73]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became president, and was sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon Chase between 10 and 11  a.m. [74]    Powell attacks Seward   An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward  Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward . On April 5 Seward had been thrown from his carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, and a broken arm. On the night of the assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park . Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War ) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , one of Seward's servants, answered the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10 pm. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [75] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.   William and Fanny Seward in 1861  Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, \"Fred, Father is awake now\" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs, but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling \"Murder! Murder!\", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, [12] : 58 but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell.\n",
            "As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [76] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [77] [78] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming \"I'm mad! I'm mad!\". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59   Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson   George Atzerodt   Andrew Johnson  Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson , who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior.  He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–7 [76] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: \"I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\" [75] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [79]  Reactions  Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln   Lincoln's funeral train  Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [76] : 350 and indeed around the world. [80] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [81] [82] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [76] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [83] : 120–3 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield, Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [84] : 31–58 [40] : 231–8    Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington crowns him with laurels. Unknown artist.  Poet Walt Whitman composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \", \" O Captain! My Captain! \", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [85] [86]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln \"incontestably the greatest man I ever knew.\" [13] : 747  Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [87] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that, \"Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.\" [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". [87]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a \"sad calamity.\" [82]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as \"inexpressibly shocked and startled\". [81]  Ecuadorian President  Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, \"Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances.\" [81] [82] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln \"not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed.\" [82] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a \"horrid crime.\" [82]   Flight and capture of the conspirators   Booth's escape route  Booth and Herold  Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland . [12] : 67–8 An army sentry questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [88]  David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81-2 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville , Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier.   Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold  An April 15 letter to Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth:  Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [37]   The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [89] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $800,000 in 2018) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [90]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in \"the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln\", [91] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, \"Tell my mother I die for my country.\" Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: \"Useless ... useless.\" He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [75] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [40] : 228   Others   The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26  Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt , but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–9  George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where he was hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [92]  Conspirators' trial and execution   Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865  Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [83] : 186–8 All were eventually released except: [83] : 188    Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt   The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:   Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin   The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [93]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General  James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–4 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–3    Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington City  The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [94] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [95] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [96] : 125, 132, 136–7 [97] : 112–5 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them, but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [26]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber, the derringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [41] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging, and secondary severe edema (or swelling of the brain that occurred after the initial injury).  While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [42] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain. [43] [44]   ^  Burroughs was also known as \"John Peanut\", \"Peanut John\", John Bohran, and other aliases.

Bachelder, this painting depicts the various people who visited Lincoln's room at different times throughout the night as he lay dying; they were not all present simultaneously.

The attack came only five days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his massive army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, effectively ending the American Civil War. John Wilkes Booth John Wilkes Booth was a Maryland native born in 1838 into a family of noted actors. Booth would eventually take the stage himself, appearing in 1855 in Shakespeare’s Richard III in Baltimore. Despite his Confederate sympathies, Booth remained in the North during the Civil War , pursuing a successful career as an actor. But as the war entered its final stages, he and several associates hatched a plot to kidnap the president and take him to Richmond, the Confederate capital. On March 20, 1865, the day of the planned kidnapping, Abraham Lincoln failed to appear at the spot where Booth and his six fellow conspirators lay in wait, foiling their planned abduction. Two weeks later, Richmond fell to Union forces, and on April 9, General Robert E. Lee  surrendered at Appomattox Court House. Growing desperate, Booth came up with an even more sinister plan to save the Confederacy. Did you know? The search for John Wilkes Booth was one of the largest manhunts in history, with 10,000 federal troops, detectives and police tracking down the assassin. Lincoln at Ford’s Theatre Learning that Lincoln was to attend Laura Keene’s acclaimed performance of “Our American Cousin” at Ford’s Theatre in Washington , D.C., on April 14, Booth masterminded a plan even more diabolical than kidnapping. He and his co-conspirators believed the simultaneous assassination of Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward –the president and two of his possible successors–would throw the U.S. government into disarray. The Lincolns arrived late for the comedy, but the president was reportedly in a fine mood and laughed heartily during the production. Lincoln occupied a private box above the stage with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln , a young army officer named Henry Rathbone and Rathbone’s fiancé, Clara Harris, the daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris. The Lincoln Assassination At 10:15, Booth slipped into the box and fired his .44-caliber single-shot derringer pistol into the back of Lincoln’s head. After stabbing Rathbone, who immediately rushed at him, in the shoulder, Booth leapt onto the stage and shouted, “Sic semper tyrannis!” (“Thus ever to tyrants!”–the Virginia state motto). At first, the crowd interpreted the unfolding drama as part of the production, but a scream from the first lady told them otherwise. Although Booth broke his leg in the fall, he managed to leave the theater and escape from Washington on horseback. A 23-year-old doctor named Charles Leale was in the audience and hastened to the presidential box immediately upon hearing the shot and Mary Lincoln’s scream. He found the president slumped in his chair, paralyzed and struggling to breathe. Several soldiers carried Lincoln to a boardinghouse across the street and placed him on a bed. When the surgeon general arrived at the house, he concluded that Lincoln could not be saved and would probably die during the night. Lincoln’s Death and Autopsy Vice President Andrew Johnson, members of Lincoln’s cabinet and several of his closest friends stood vigil by the president’s bedside in the boardinghouse. The first lady lay on a bed in an adjoining room with her eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, at her side, overwhelmed with shock and grief. Finally, Lincoln was pronounced dead at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865, at the age of 56. The president’s body was placed in a temporary coffin, draped with a flag and escorted by armed cavalry to the White House , where surgeons conducted a thorough autopsy. During the autopsy, Mary Lincoln sent the surgeons a note requesting that they clip a lock of Lincoln’s hair for her. Edward Curtis, an Army surgeon in attendance, later described the scene, recounting that a bullet clattered into a waiting basin during the doctors’ removal of Lincoln’s brain. He wrote that the team stopped to stare at the offending bullet, “the cause of such mighty changes in the world’s history as we may perhaps never realize.” A Nation Mourns News of the president’s death traveled quickly, and by the end of the day flags across the country flew at half-mast, businesses were closed and people who had recently rejoiced at the end of the Civil War now reeled from Lincoln’s shocking assassination. On April 18, Lincoln’s body was carried to the Capitol rotunda to lay in state on a catafalque. Three days later, his remains were boarded onto a train that conveyed him to Springfield, Illinois , where he had lived before becoming president. Tens of thousands of Americans lined the railroad route and paid their respects to their fallen leader during the train’s solemn progression through the North. Lincoln and his son, William Wallace Lincoln (“Willie”), who died in the White House of typhoid fever in 1862, were interred on May 4, 1865, at Oak Ridge Cemetery near Springfield. Mary Todd Lincoln was so devastated that she took to her bed for weeks and missed the funeral. She was soon outcast from society for her vocal grief. John Wilkes Booth Flees As the nation mourned, Union soldiers were hot on the trail of John Wilkes Booth, who many in the audience had immediately recognized. After fleeing the capital, he and an accomplice, David Herold, made their way across the Anacostia River and headed toward southern Maryland. The pair stopped at the home of Samuel Mudd, a doctor who treated Booth’s broken leg. (Mudd’s actions earned him a life sentence that was later commuted.) They then sought refuge from Thomas A. Jones, a Confederate agent, before securing a boat to row across the Potomac to Virginia. On April 26, Union troops surrounded the Virginia barn where Booth and Herold were hiding out and set fire to it, hoping to flush the fugitives out. Herold surrendered but Booth remained inside. As the blaze intensified, a sergeant shot Booth in the neck, allegedly because the assassin had raised his gun as if to shoot. Carried out of the building alive, Booth lingered for three hours before gazing at his hands and uttering his last words: “Useless, useless.” Four of Booth’s co-conspirators were convicted for their part in the assassination and executed by hanging on July 7, 1865. They included David Herold and Mary Surratt , the first woman put to death by the federal government, whose boardinghouse had served as a meeting place for the would-be kidnappers.

The president’s death came only six days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his massive army at Appomattox , effectively ending the American Civil War . Booth, who remained in the North during the war despite his Confederate sympathies, initially plotted to capture President Lincoln and take him to Richmond, the Confederate capital. However, on March 20, 1865, the day of the planned kidnapping, the president failed to appear at the spot where Booth and his six fellow conspirators lay in wait. Two weeks later, Richmond fell to Union forces. In April, with Confederate armies near collapse across the South, Booth hatched a desperate plan to save the Confederacy. Learning that Lincoln was to attend Laura Keene’s acclaimed performance in Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theater on April 14, Booth plotted the simultaneous assassination of Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson , and Secretary of State William H. Seward. By murdering the president and two of his possible successors, Booth and his conspirators hoped to throw the U.S. government into a paralyzing disarray. On the evening of April 14, conspirator Lewis T. Powell burst into Secretary of State Seward’s home, seriously wounding him and three others, while George A. Atzerodt, assigned to Vice President Johnson, lost his nerve and fled. Meanwhile, just after 10 p.m., Booth entered Lincoln’s private box unnoticed and shot the president with a single bullet in the back of his head. Slashing an army officer who rushed at him, Booth jumped to the stage and shouted “Sic semper tyrannis! [Thus always to tyrants]–the South is avenged!” Although Booth had broken his left leg jumping from Lincoln’s box, he succeeded in escaping Washington . The president, mortally wounded, was carried to a cheap lodging house opposite Ford’s Theater. An hour after dawn the next morning, Abraham Lincoln died, becoming the first president to be assassinated. His body was taken to the White House , where it lay until April 18, at which point it was carried to the Capitol rotunda to lay in state on a catafalque. On April 21, Lincoln’s body was taken to the railroad station and boarded on a train that conveyed it to Springfield, Illinois , his home before becoming president.  Tens of thousands of Americans lined the train’s railroad route and paid their respects to their fallen leader during the train’s solemn progression through the North. Lincoln was buried on May 4, 1865, at Oak Ridge Cemetery, near Springfield. Booth, pursued by the army and secret service forces, was finally cornered in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia , and died from a possibly self-inflicted bullet wound as the barn was burned to the ground. Of the eight other persons eventually charged with the conspiracy, four were hanged and four were jailed.

Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the North into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–4 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as \"Lewis Paine\"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House. [11] : 325–6 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: \"What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!\" [7] : 174, 437n.41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel ; [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–6, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army. On April 9 the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to the Commanding General of the United States Army  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House .  Confederate President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. But Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes Booth greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: \"John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!\" [16] [17] On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's speech at the White House in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks; [18] Booth said\n",
            "\"That means nigger citizenship  ... That is the last speech he will ever give.\" Enraged, Booth urged Lewis Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed and/or because he considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is not exactly known. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally make an attempt on the President's life. However, Booth said to David Herold, \"By God, I'll put him through.\" [19] [8] : 91   Lincoln's premonitions  According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:  I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. \"Who is dead in the White House?\" I demanded of one of the soldiers, \"The President,\" was his answer; \"he was killed by an assassin.\" [20]   However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that \"In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.\" [21] [22] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [21]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [23] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a \"singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore\", and that he'd had the same dream before \"nearly every great and important event of the War\" such as the victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [24]   Preparations   Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865)  On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well, but that he was \"in haste\". In his diary, he wrote that \"Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done\". [13] : 728 [23] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–9 He went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19    Ford's Theatre  The conspirators met for the final time at 7  p.m. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. John Wilkes Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. It is likely he reasonably (but ultimately, incorrectly) assumed that the entrance of the Presidential Box would be guarded and that he would be the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Deringer , and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre . They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212   Assassination of Lincoln   Lincoln's box  Lincoln arrives at the theater  Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [25] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point Mary Lincoln developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [27] One of Lincoln's bodyguards, William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [28] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , \"I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay\" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted and the orchestra played \" Hail to the Chief \" as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [29] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [30] [31]    Booth's Philadelphia Deringer  The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, \"Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft \" – was delivered instead as, \"The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!\" [32] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and \"seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment.\" [33]  At one point Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" Lincoln replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". [12] : 39 In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [34]   Booth shoots Lincoln   This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot.  With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the president's box. [35] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's footman and coachman. It is unclear whether he returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [36] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth, and the fact that Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box would indicate he was expecting a guard. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [37]   About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the \"Pres\" box was and I heard a man say, \"There's Booth\" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in.  Once through this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain. [38] [39] : 173    Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): \"At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth.\"  Booth knew the play by heart, and waited to time his shot with the laughter at one of the best lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : \"Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\". Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. [40] : 96  Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer . [2] The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [43] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [45] [46] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like \"Freedom!\" [47]   Booth escapes   Booth's dagger  Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [48] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head, and yelled something to the audience.\n",
            "While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! (\"Thus always to tyrants\") either from the box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [49] [50] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either \"The South is avenged!\", [12] : 48 \"Revenge for the South!\", or \"The South shall be free!\" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: \"I have done it!\") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights, and pursued Booth across the stage. [48] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of \"Stop that man!\" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth ran across the stage and exited through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [51] [52] Booth had left a horse waiting outside in the alleyway.  As he leapt into the saddle Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs [d] (the man holding the horse) away, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [53] [54] [55] [1]   Death of Lincoln   Surgeon Charles Leale  Charles Leale , a young Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut. [8] : 120  Leale entered the box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [42] as Mary held him and sobbed: \"His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous .\" [56] [57] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted from the stage into the box. After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to dislodge a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–2 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78    Skull fragments and probe used.  Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [58] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [59] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed. [8] : 123–4    Lincoln's deathbed [e]  More physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [61] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, \"to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend.\" [8] : 14 [62]  Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived sometime after midnight but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mary Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and his confederates. [8] : 127–8 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [61]    The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [f]  Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [63]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started \"breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.\" [64] [65] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became \"perfectly natural\" [64] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [66] Shortly before 7  a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [67] and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" [68]  Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [69] [70] In his last moments Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [71] Field wrote there was \"no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing\". [64] [65] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\". [72] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either \"Now he belongs to the ages\" or \"Now he belongs to the angels.\" [8] : 134 [73]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became president, and was sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon Chase between 10 and 11  a.m. [74]    Powell attacks Seward   An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward  Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward . On April 5 Seward had been thrown from his carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, and a broken arm. On the night of the assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park . Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War ) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , one of Seward's servants, answered the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10 pm. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [75] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.   William and Fanny Seward in 1861  Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, \"Fred, Father is awake now\" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs, but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling \"Murder! Murder!\", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, [12] : 58 but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell.\n",
            "As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [76] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [77] [78] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming \"I'm mad! I'm mad!\". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59   Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson   George Atzerodt   Andrew Johnson  Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson , who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior.  He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–7 [76] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: \"I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\" [75] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [79]  Reactions  Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln   Lincoln's funeral train  Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [76] : 350 and indeed around the world. [80] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [81] [82] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [76] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [83] : 120–3 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield, Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [84] : 31–58 [40] : 231–8    Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington crowns him with laurels. Unknown artist.  Poet Walt Whitman composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \", \" O Captain! My Captain! \", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [85] [86]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln \"incontestably the greatest man I ever knew.\" [13] : 747  Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [87] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that, \"Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.\" [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". [87]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a \"sad calamity.\" [82]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as \"inexpressibly shocked and startled\". [81]  Ecuadorian President  Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, \"Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances.\" [81] [82] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln \"not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed.\" [82] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a \"horrid crime.\" [82]   Flight and capture of the conspirators   Booth's escape route  Booth and Herold  Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland . [12] : 67–8 An army sentry questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [88]  David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81-2 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville , Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier.   Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold  An April 15 letter to Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth:  Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [37]   The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [89] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $800,000 in 2018) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [90]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in \"the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln\", [91] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, \"Tell my mother I die for my country.\" Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: \"Useless ... useless.\" He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [75] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [40] : 228   Others   The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26  Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt , but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–9  George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where he was hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [92]  Conspirators' trial and execution   Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865  Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [83] : 186–8 All were eventually released except: [83] : 188    Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt   The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:   Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin   The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [93]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General  James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–4 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–3    Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington City  The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [94] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [95] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [96] : 125, 132, 136–7 [97] : 112–5 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them, but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [26]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber, the derringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [41] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging, and secondary severe edema (or swelling of the brain that occurred after the initial injury).  While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [42] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain. [43] [44]   ^  Burroughs was also known as \"John Peanut\", \"Peanut John\", John Bohran, and other aliases. [1]   ^  Julius Ulke, who was a boarder at the Petersen House , took this photograph shortly after the President's body was removed. [60]   ^  Designed by John B. Bachelder, this painting depicts the various people who visited Lincoln's room at different times throughout the night as he lay dying; they were not all present simultaneously.

Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am, in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated, [4] and Lincoln's funeral and burial marked an extended period of national mourning. Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government .\n",
            "Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .\n",
            "Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.

John Wilkes Booth, born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right.\n",
            "He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore . [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the North into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–4 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as \"Lewis Paine\"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House. [11] : 325–6 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: \"What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!\" [7] : 174, 437n.41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel ; [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–6, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army. On April 9 the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to the Commanding General of the United States Army  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House .  Confederate President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. But Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes Booth greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: \"John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!\" [16] [17] On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's speech at the White House in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks; [18] Booth said\n",
            "\"That means nigger citizenship  ... That is the last speech he will ever give.\" Enraged, Booth urged Lewis Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed and/or because he considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is not exactly known. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally make an attempt on the President's life. However, Booth said to David Herold, \"By God, I'll put him through.\" [19] [8] : 91   Lincoln's premonitions  According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:  I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. \"Who is dead in the White House?\" I demanded of one of the soldiers, \"The President,\" was his answer; \"he was killed by an assassin.\" [20]   However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that \"In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.\" [21] [22] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [21]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [23] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a \"singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore\", and that he'd had the same dream before \"nearly every great and important event of the War\" such as the victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [24]   Preparations   Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865)  On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well, but that he was \"in haste\". In his diary, he wrote that \"Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done\". [13] : 728 [23] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–9 He went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19    Ford's Theatre  The conspirators met for the final time at 7  p.m. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. John Wilkes Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. It is likely he reasonably (but ultimately, incorrectly) assumed that the entrance of the Presidential Box would be guarded and that he would be the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Deringer , and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre . They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212   Assassination of Lincoln   Lincoln's box  Lincoln arrives at the theater  Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [25] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point Mary Lincoln developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [27] One of Lincoln's bodyguards, William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [28] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , \"I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay\" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted and the orchestra played \" Hail to the Chief \" as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [29] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [30] [31]    Booth's Philadelphia Deringer  The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, \"Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft \" – was delivered instead as, \"The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!\" [32] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and \"seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment.\" [33]  At one point Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" Lincoln replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". [12] : 39 In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [34]   Booth shoots Lincoln   This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot.  With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the president's box. [35] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's footman and coachman. It is unclear whether he returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [36] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth, and the fact that Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box would indicate he was expecting a guard. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [37]   About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the \"Pres\" box was and I heard a man say, \"There's Booth\" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in.  Once through this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain. [38] [39] : 173    Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): \"At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth.\"  Booth knew the play by heart, and waited to time his shot with the laughter at one of the best lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : \"Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\". Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. [40] : 96  Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer . [2] The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [43] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [45] [46] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like \"Freedom!\" [47]   Booth escapes   Booth's dagger  Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [48] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head, and yelled something to the audience.\n",
            "While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! (\"Thus always to tyrants\") either from the box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [49] [50] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either \"The South is avenged!\", [12] : 48 \"Revenge for the South!\", or \"The South shall be free!\" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: \"I have done it!\") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights, and pursued Booth across the stage. [48] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of \"Stop that man!\" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth ran across the stage and exited through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [51] [52] Booth had left a horse waiting outside in the alleyway.  As he leapt into the saddle Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs [d] (the man holding the horse) away, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [53] [54] [55] [1]   Death of Lincoln   Surgeon Charles Leale  Charles Leale , a young Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut. [8] : 120  Leale entered the box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [42] as Mary held him and sobbed: \"His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous .\" [56] [57] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted from the stage into the box. After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to dislodge a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–2 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78    Skull fragments and probe used.  Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [58] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [59] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed. [8] : 123–4    Lincoln's deathbed [e]  More physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [61] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, \"to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend.\" [8] : 14 [62]  Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived sometime after midnight but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mary Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and his confederates. [8] : 127–8 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [61]    The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [f]  Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [63]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started \"breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.\" [64] [65] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became \"perfectly natural\" [64] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [66] Shortly before 7  a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [67] and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" [68]  Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [69] [70] In his last moments Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [71] Field wrote there was \"no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing\". [64] [65] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\". [72] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either \"Now he belongs to the ages\" or \"Now he belongs to the angels.\" [8] : 134 [73]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became president, and was sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon Chase between 10 and 11  a.m. [74]    Powell attacks Seward   An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward  Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward . On April 5 Seward had been thrown from his carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, and a broken arm. On the night of the assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park . Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War ) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , one of Seward's servants, answered the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10 pm. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [75] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.   William and Fanny Seward in 1861  Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, \"Fred, Father is awake now\" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs, but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling \"Murder! Murder!\", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, [12] : 58 but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell.\n",
            "As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [76] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [77] [78] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming \"I'm mad! I'm mad!\". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59   Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson   George Atzerodt   Andrew Johnson  Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson , who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior.  He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–7 [76] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: \"I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\" [75] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [79]  Reactions  Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln   Lincoln's funeral train  Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [76] : 350 and indeed around the world. [80] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [81] [82] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [76] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [83] : 120–3 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield, Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [84] : 31–58 [40] : 231–8    Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington crowns him with laurels. Unknown artist.  Poet Walt Whitman composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \", \" O Captain! My Captain! \", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [85] [86]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln \"incontestably the greatest man I ever knew.\" [13] : 747  Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [87] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that, \"Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.\" [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". [87]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a \"sad calamity.\" [82]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as \"inexpressibly shocked and startled\". [81]  Ecuadorian President  Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, \"Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances.\" [81] [82] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln \"not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed.\" [82] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a \"horrid crime.\" [82]   Flight and capture of the conspirators   Booth's escape route  Booth and Herold  Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland . [12] : 67–8 An army sentry questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [88]  David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81-2 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville , Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier.   Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold  An April 15 letter to Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth:  Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [37]   The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [89] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $800,000 in 2018) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [90]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in \"the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln\", [91] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, \"Tell my mother I die for my country.\" Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: \"Useless ... useless.\" He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [75] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [40] : 228   Others   The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26  Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt , but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–9  George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where he was hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [92]  Conspirators' trial and execution   Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865  Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [83] : 186–8 All were eventually released except: [83] : 188    Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt   The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:   Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin   The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [93]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General  James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–4 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–3    Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington City  The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [94] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [95] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [96] : 125, 132, 136–7 [97] : 112–5 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them, but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [26]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber, the derringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [41] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging, and secondary severe edema (or swelling of the brain that occurred after the initial injury).  While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [42] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain.

Robinson  Emerick Hansell  Perpetrators John Wilkes Booth and co-conspirators Motive Revenge for the Confederate States  Abraham Lincoln , the 16th President of the United States , was assassinated by well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am, in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated, [4] and Lincoln's funeral and burial marked an extended period of national mourning. Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government .\n",
            "Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .\n",
            "Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.

John Wilkes Booth, born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right.\n",
            "He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore . [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the North into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–4 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as \"Lewis Paine\"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House. [11] : 325–6 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: \"What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!\" [7] : 174, 437n.41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel ; [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–6, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army. On April 9 the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to the Commanding General of the United States Army  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House .  Confederate President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. But Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes Booth greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: \"John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!\" [16] [17] On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's speech at the White House in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks; [18] Booth said\n",
            "\"That means nigger citizenship  ... That is the last speech he will ever give.\" Enraged, Booth urged Lewis Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed and/or because he considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is not exactly known. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally make an attempt on the President's life. However, Booth said to David Herold, \"By God, I'll put him through.\" [19] [8] : 91   Lincoln's premonitions  According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:  I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. \"Who is dead in the White House?\" I demanded of one of the soldiers, \"The President,\" was his answer; \"he was killed by an assassin.\" [20]   However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that \"In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.\" [21] [22] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [21]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [23] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a \"singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore\", and that he'd had the same dream before \"nearly every great and important event of the War\" such as the victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [24]   Preparations   Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865)  On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well, but that he was \"in haste\". In his diary, he wrote that \"Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done\". [13] : 728 [23] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–9 He went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19    Ford's Theatre  The conspirators met for the final time at 7  p.m. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. John Wilkes Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. It is likely he reasonably (but ultimately, incorrectly) assumed that the entrance of the Presidential Box would be guarded and that he would be the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Deringer , and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre . They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212   Assassination of Lincoln   Lincoln's box  Lincoln arrives at the theater  Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [25] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point Mary Lincoln developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [27] One of Lincoln's bodyguards, William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [28] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , \"I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay\" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted and the orchestra played \" Hail to the Chief \" as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [29] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [30] [31]    Booth's Philadelphia Deringer  The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, \"Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft \" – was delivered instead as, \"The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!\" [32] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and \"seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment.\" [33]  At one point Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" Lincoln replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". [12] : 39 In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [34]   Booth shoots Lincoln   This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot.  With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the president's box. [35] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's footman and coachman. It is unclear whether he returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [36] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth, and the fact that Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box would indicate he was expecting a guard. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [37]   About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the \"Pres\" box was and I heard a man say, \"There's Booth\" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in.  Once through this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain. [38] [39] : 173    Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): \"At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth.\"  Booth knew the play by heart, and waited to time his shot with the laughter at one of the best lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : \"Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\". Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. [40] : 96  Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer . [2] The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [43] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [45] [46] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like \"Freedom!\" [47]   Booth escapes   Booth's dagger  Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [48] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head, and yelled something to the audience.\n",
            "While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! (\"Thus always to tyrants\") either from the box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [49] [50] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either \"The South is avenged!\", [12] : 48 \"Revenge for the South!\", or \"The South shall be free!\" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: \"I have done it!\") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights, and pursued Booth across the stage. [48] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of \"Stop that man!\" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth ran across the stage and exited through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [51] [52] Booth had left a horse waiting outside in the alleyway.  As he leapt into the saddle Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs [d] (the man holding the horse) away, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [53] [54] [55] [1]   Death of Lincoln   Surgeon Charles Leale  Charles Leale , a young Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut. [8] : 120  Leale entered the box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [42] as Mary held him and sobbed: \"His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous .\" [56] [57] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted from the stage into the box. After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to dislodge a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–2 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78    Skull fragments and probe used.  Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [58] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [59] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed. [8] : 123–4    Lincoln's deathbed [e]  More physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [61] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, \"to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend.\" [8] : 14 [62]  Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived sometime after midnight but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mary Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and his confederates. [8] : 127–8 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [61]    The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [f]  Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [63]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started \"breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.\" [64] [65] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became \"perfectly natural\" [64] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [66] Shortly before 7  a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [67] and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" [68]  Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [69] [70] In his last moments Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [71] Field wrote there was \"no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing\". [64] [65] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\". [72] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either \"Now he belongs to the ages\" or \"Now he belongs to the angels.\" [8] : 134 [73]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became president, and was sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon Chase between 10 and 11  a.m. [74]    Powell attacks Seward   An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward  Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward . On April 5 Seward had been thrown from his carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, and a broken arm. On the night of the assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park . Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War ) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , one of Seward's servants, answered the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10 pm. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [75] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.   William and Fanny Seward in 1861  Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, \"Fred, Father is awake now\" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs, but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling \"Murder! Murder!\", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, [12] : 58 but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell.\n",
            "As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [76] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [77] [78] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming \"I'm mad! I'm mad!\". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59   Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson   George Atzerodt   Andrew Johnson  Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson , who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior.  He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–7 [76] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: \"I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\" [75] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [79]  Reactions  Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln   Lincoln's funeral train  Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [76] : 350 and indeed around the world. [80] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [81] [82] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [76] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [83] : 120–3 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield, Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [84] : 31–58 [40] : 231–8    Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington crowns him with laurels. Unknown artist.  Poet Walt Whitman composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \", \" O Captain! My Captain! \", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [85] [86]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln \"incontestably the greatest man I ever knew.\" [13] : 747  Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [87] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that, \"Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.\" [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". [87]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a \"sad calamity.\" [82]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as \"inexpressibly shocked and startled\". [81]  Ecuadorian President  Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, \"Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances.\" [81] [82] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln \"not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed.\" [82] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a \"horrid crime.\" [82]   Flight and capture of the conspirators   Booth's escape route  Booth and Herold  Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland . [12] : 67–8 An army sentry questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [88]  David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81-2 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville , Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier.   Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold  An April 15 letter to Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth:  Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [37]   The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [89] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $800,000 in 2018) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [90]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in \"the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln\", [91] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, \"Tell my mother I die for my country.\" Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: \"Useless ... useless.\" He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [75] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [40] : 228   Others   The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26  Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt , but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–9  George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where he was hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [92]  Conspirators' trial and execution   Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865  Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [83] : 186–8 All were eventually released except: [83] : 188    Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt   The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:   Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin   The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [93]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General  James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–4 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–3    Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington City  The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [94] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [95] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [96] : 125, 132, 136–7 [97] : 112–5 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them, but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [26]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber, the derringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [41] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging, and secondary severe edema (or swelling of the brain that occurred after the initial injury).  While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [42] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain.

Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am, in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated, [4] and Lincoln's funeral and burial marked an extended period of national mourning. Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government .\n",
            "Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .\n",
            "Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.

John Wilkes Booth, born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right.\n",
            "He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore . [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the North into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–4 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as \"Lewis Paine\"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House. [11] : 325–6 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: \"What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!\" [7] : 174, 437n.41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel ; [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–6, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army. On April 9 the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to the Commanding General of the United States Army  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House .  Confederate President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. But Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes Booth greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: \"John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!\" [16] [17] On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's speech at the White House in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks; [18] Booth said\n",
            "\"That means nigger citizenship  ... That is the last speech he will ever give.\" Enraged, Booth urged Lewis Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed and/or because he considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is not exactly known. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally make an attempt on the President's life. However, Booth said to David Herold, \"By God, I'll put him through.\" [19] [8] : 91   Lincoln's premonitions  According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:  I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. \"Who is dead in the White House?\" I demanded of one of the soldiers, \"The President,\" was his answer; \"he was killed by an assassin.\" [20]   However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that \"In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.\" [21] [22] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [21]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [23] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a \"singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore\", and that he'd had the same dream before \"nearly every great and important event of the War\" such as the victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [24]   Preparations   Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865)  On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well, but that he was \"in haste\". In his diary, he wrote that \"Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done\". [13] : 728 [23] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–9 He went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19    Ford's Theatre  The conspirators met for the final time at 7  p.m. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. John Wilkes Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. It is likely he reasonably (but ultimately, incorrectly) assumed that the entrance of the Presidential Box would be guarded and that he would be the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Deringer , and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre . They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212   Assassination of Lincoln   Lincoln's box  Lincoln arrives at the theater  Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [25] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of New York Senator Ira Harris ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point Mary Lincoln developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [27] One of Lincoln's bodyguards, William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [28] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , \"I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay\" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted and the orchestra played \" Hail to the Chief \" as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [29] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [30] [31]    Booth's Philadelphia Deringer  The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, \"Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft \" – was delivered instead as, \"The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!\" [32] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and \"seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment.\" [33]  At one point Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" Lincoln replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". [12] : 39 In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [34]   Booth shoots Lincoln   This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot.  With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the president's box. [35] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's footman and coachman. It is unclear whether he returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [36] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth, and the fact that Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box would indicate he was expecting a guard. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [37]   About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the \"Pres\" box was and I heard a man say, \"There's Booth\" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in.  Once through this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain. [38] [39] : 173    Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): \"At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth.\"  Booth knew the play by heart, and waited to time his shot with the laughter at one of the best lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : \"Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\". Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. [40] : 96  Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer . [2] The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [43] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [45] [46] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like \"Freedom!\" [47]   Booth escapes   Booth's dagger  Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [48] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head, and yelled something to the audience.\n",
            "While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! (\"Thus always to tyrants\") either from the box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [49] [50] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either \"The South is avenged!\", [12] : 48 \"Revenge for the South!\", or \"The South shall be free!\" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: \"I have done it!\") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights, and pursued Booth across the stage. [48] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of \"Stop that man!\" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth ran across the stage and exited through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [51] [52] Booth had left a horse waiting outside in the alleyway.  As he leapt into the saddle Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs [d] (the man holding the horse) away, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [53] [54] [55] [1]   Death of Lincoln   Surgeon Charles Leale  Charles Leale , a young Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of Lincoln's box but found it would not open. Rathbone, inside the door, soon noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed it shut. [8] : 120  Leale entered the box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [42] as Mary held him and sobbed: \"His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous .\" [56] [57] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted from the stage into the box. After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to dislodge a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–2 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78    Skull fragments and probe used.  Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that while Lincoln must be moved, a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded to take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It rained as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [58] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [59] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on the bed. [8] : 123–4    Lincoln's deathbed [e]  More physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [61] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, \"to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend.\" [8] : 14 [62]  Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived sometime after midnight but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mary Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and his confederates. [8] : 127–8 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [61]    The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [f]  Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [63]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started \"breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.\" [64] [65] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became \"perfectly natural\" [64] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [66] Shortly before 7  a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [67] and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" [68]  Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [69] [70] In his last moments Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [71] Field wrote there was \"no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing\". [64] [65] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\". [72] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either \"Now he belongs to the ages\" or \"Now he belongs to the angels.\" [8] : 134 [73]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became president, and was sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon Chase between 10 and 11  a.m. [74]    Powell attacks Seward   An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward  Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward . On April 5 Seward had been thrown from his carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, and a broken arm. On the night of the assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park . Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War ) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , one of Seward's servants, answered the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10 pm. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [75] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.   William and Fanny Seward in 1861  Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, \"Fred, Father is awake now\" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs, but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling \"Murder! Murder!\", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, [12] : 58 but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell.\n",
            "As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [76] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [77] [78] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming \"I'm mad! I'm mad!\". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59   Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson   George Atzerodt   Andrew Johnson  Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson , who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior.  He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–7 [76] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: \"I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\" [75] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [79]  Reactions  Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln   Lincoln's funeral train  Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [76] : 350 and indeed around the world. [80] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [81] [82] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [76] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [83] : 120–3 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield, Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [84] : 31–58 [40] : 231–8    Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington crowns him with laurels. Unknown artist.  Poet Walt Whitman composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \", \" O Captain! My Captain! \", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [85] [86]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln \"incontestably the greatest man I ever knew.\" [13] : 747  Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [87] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that, \"Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.\" [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". [87]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a \"sad calamity.\" [82]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as \"inexpressibly shocked and startled\". [81]  Ecuadorian President  Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, \"Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances.\" [81] [82] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln \"not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed.\" [82] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a \"horrid crime.\" [82]   Flight and capture of the conspirators   Booth's escape route  Booth and Herold  Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland . [12] : 67–8 An army sentry questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [88]  David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81-2 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville , Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier.   Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold  An April 15 letter to Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth:  Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [37]   The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [89] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $800,000 in 2018) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [90]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in \"the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln\", [91] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, \"Tell my mother I die for my country.\" Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: \"Useless ... useless.\" He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [75] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [40] : 228   Others   The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26  Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt , but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–9  George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where he was hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [92]  Conspirators' trial and execution   Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865  Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [83] : 186–8 All were eventually released except: [83] : 188    Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt   The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:   Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin   The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [93]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General  James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–4 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–3    Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington City  The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [94] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [95] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [96] : 125, 132, 136–7 [97] : 112–5 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them, but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [26]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber, the derringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [41] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging, and secondary severe edema (or swelling of the brain that occurred after the initial injury).  While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [42] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain.

Shot in the head by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth , Lincoln died the next morning. The assassination occurred only days after the surrender at Appomattox Court House of Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia to Union forces led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant , which had signaled the effective end of the American Civil War . Lincoln’s death plunged much of the country into despair, and the search for Booth and his accomplices was the largest manhunt in American history to that date. The assassination of U.S. Pres. Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth, April 14, 1865, lithograph by Currier & Ives. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital file no. 3b49830u) Lincoln, Abraham U.S. Pres. Abraham Lincoln, February 5, 1865, photograph by Alexander Gardner. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Booth was a member of one of America’s most renowned families of actors. His brother Edwin Booth was widely regarded as the country’s leading actor, a mantle he had inherited from their father, Junius Brutus Booth, and John Wilkes Booth was an acclaimed performer in his own right, celebrated for his charisma , athleticism, and dashing good looks. He grew up in the border state of Maryland but was particularly popular as an actor in Richmond , Virginia , and considered himself a Southerner. Moreover, he passionately advocated the slave system. Having promised his mother that he would not fight for the Confederacy , Booth remained in the North during the Civil War, and his hatred of abolitionists and Lincoln deepened. In March 1865 he and a group of conspirators in Washington, D.C., plotted to abduct Lincoln, though none of those plans came to fruition. Booth, John Wilkes John Wilkes Booth.

On the morning of April 14, 1865, Booth—distraught over the collapse of the Confederacy—learned that the president would be attending a performance of the comedy Our American Cousin that evening at Ford’s Theatre. Gathering his fellow conspirators, Booth outlined a plan to assassinate not just President Lincoln but also Vice Pres. Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward . Booth tasked Lewis Powell, a tall and powerful former Confederate soldier, with the attack on Seward, to be aided by David Herold . George Atzerodt, a German immigrant who had acted as a boatman for Confederate spies, was to kill Johnson. Booth himself was to assassinate Lincoln. All three attacks were to occur at the same time (about 10:00 pm ) that night. In the event, Atzerodt failed to carry out his assignment and never approached Johnson. Powell invaded Seward’s home and slashed him repeatedly with a knife . Seward survived the attack, but his face was permanently disfigured.

Henry Rathbone (there because a number of more prominent people had declined the Lincolns’ invitation). Finding the president’s box essentially unguarded, Booth entered it and barred the outside door from inside. Then, at a moment in the play that he knew would elicit a big laugh, Booth burst in through the box’s inner door. He shot Lincoln in the back of the head once with a .44 calibre derringer, slashed Rathbone in the shoulder with a knife, and leapt from the box to the stage below, breaking his left leg in the fall (though some believe that injury did not occur until later). What Booth said while committing the attack and when he said it are a matter of some dispute. Audience members variously reported that he exclaimed, “Sic semper tyrannis” (“Thus always to tyrants,” the state motto of Virginia) or “The South is avenged!” or both, before disappearing through a door at the side of the stage where his horse was being held for him. On the other hand, in a note written a few days after the assassination, Booth claimed that he had shouted “Sic semper” before he fired (though it seems likely that this was Booth’s attempt at dramatizing history). In any case, Booth rode off into the night and out of Washington, meeting up in Maryland with Herold, who had fled the scene of the Seward attack without Powell. derringer used to assassinate Pres. Abraham Lincoln Derringer used to assassinate U.S. Pres. Abraham Lincoln; in the Ford's Theatre National Historic Site, Washington, D.C. Forensic Science Communications/Federal Bureau of Investigation The Assassination of President Lincoln at Ford's Theatre—After the Act , wood engraving from Harper's Weekly , April 29, 1865. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Lincoln was attended to immediately by several doctors who were in the audience. It was felt that the president should not be moved far, so he was taken across the street to the house of William Petersen, who rented extra rooms to lodgers. In one of those rooms Lincoln was laid diagonally across a bed, for which he was otherwise too tall. Doctors had little hope that the unconscious Lincoln would recover, and throughout the night various cabinet members, officials, and physicians kept vigil in the small room. Mary grieved hysterically. When Lincoln was pronounced dead at 7:22 am on April 15, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton famously pronounced, “Now he belongs to the ages” (or “to the angels”; witnesses disagree). The next day was Easter Sunday, and throughout America sermons in Christian churches equated Lincoln’s martyrdom with Jesus ’ sacrificial death. A period of national mourning ensued. Observers reported that African Americans felt Lincoln’s loss particularly keenly. Historians have noted that Lincoln—whom many even in the North deeply disliked—became much more revered in death than in life as the myth surrounding him grew. After public viewing in both the White House and the Capitol , Lincoln’s body, in an elaborate open coffin, was taken on a 13-day train journey across the country to his home in Springfield , Illinois, stopping en route to lie in state in Independence Hall in Philadelphia and to be paraded in a hearse down 5th Avenue in New York City , among other stops. Millions of people lined the train route to pay their respects. Statue of Abraham Lincoln, designed by Daniel Chester French, in the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C. Photos.com/Jupiterimages As for the perpetrators, the fleeing Booth had his leg treated in Maryland by Dr. Samuel Mudd , who would later be convicted of conspiracy , though his descendants waged a protracted battle to prove his innocence. While a massive manhunt, fueled by a $100,000 reward, filled the countryside surrounding Washington with troops and other searchers, Booth and Herold, aided by a Confederate sympathizer, hid for days in a thicket of trees near the Zekiah swamp in Maryland. While hiding, Booth kept a diary in which he recorded his incredulity at the almost universal condemnation of his actions. He had expected to be heralded as a hero. Having undertaken further efforts to escape, Booth and Herold were tracked down by federal troops on April 26 at a farm in Virginia, near the Rappahannock River . There Herold surrendered before the barn in which he and Booth were hiding was set aflame. Refusing to surrender, Booth was shot, either by a soldier or by himself, and died shortly thereafter. Rumours persisted that it was not Booth but another man thought to be him who was killed, but there is no acceptable evidence to support that notion. Broadside advertising a $100,000 reward for the capture of John Surratt, John Wilkes Booth, and David Harold (a misspelling of Herold), suspected of conspiring in the assassination of U.S. Pres.

(digital file no. 3g05341u) Eight “conspirators” were tried by a military commission for Lincoln’s murder (several of them had participated in the plot to kidnap Lincoln but were less clearly involved in the assassination attempt). Herold, Powell, Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt , who ran a boarding house in Washington frequented by members of the Confederate underground, were found guilty and hanged. Also found guilty, Mudd, Michael O’Laughlen, and Samuel Arnold were sentenced to life in prison, and Edman Spangler received a six-year sentence. Another conspirator, John Surratt, Jr. , fled the country but was later captured and stood trial in 1867, though his case was dismissed.

Accompanying him at Ford's Theatre that night were his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, a twenty-eight year-old officer named Major Henry R. Rathbone, and Rathbone's fiancée, Clara Harris.  After the play was in progress, a figure with a drawn derringer pistol stepped into the presidential box , aimed, and fired .  The president slumped forward.    The Martyr of liberty... [n. p., n. d.] (Library of Congress, Stern Collection, Rare Book and Special Collections Division.)   The assassin, John Wilkes Booth , dropped the pistol and waved a dagger .  Rathbone lunged at him, and though slashed in the arm, forced the killer to the railing.  Booth leapt from the balcony and caught the spur of his left boot on a flag draped over the rail, and broke a bone in his leg on landing.  Though injured, he rushed out the back door, and disappeared into the night on horseback.  A doctor in the audience, Dr. Charles Leale, immediately went upstairs to the box.  The bullet had entered through Lincoln's left ear and lodged behind his right eye.  He was paralyzed and barely breathing.  He was carried across Tenth Street, to a boarding-house opposite the theater, but the doctors' best efforts failed.  Nine hours later, at 7:22 a.m. on April 15th, Lincoln died .    President Lincoln's funeral procession in New York City . From Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865. (Library of Congress, Stern Collection, Rare Book and Special Collections Division. )   At almost the same moment Booth fired the fatal shot, his accomplice, Lewis Powell (alias Lewis Paine, Lewis Payne), attacked Lincoln's secretary of state, William Henry Seward , at his home on Lafayette Square.  Seward lay in bed, recovering from a carriage accident.  Powell entered the mansion, claiming to have a delivery of medicine from the secretary's doctor.  Seward's son, Frederick, was brutally beaten while trying to keep Powell from his father's door.  Powell slashed the secretary's throat twice, then fought his way past Seward's son Augustus, an attending hospital corps veteran, and a State Department messenger.  Powell escaped into the night, believing his deed complete.  However, a metal surgical collar saved Seward from certain death.  The secretary lived another seven years, during which he retained his seat with the Johnson administration, and purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.  There were at least four conspirators in addition to Booth involved in the mayhem.  Booth was shot and captured while hiding in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia, and died later the same day, April 26, 1865.  Four co-conspirators, Powell , George Atzerodt , David Herold , and Mary Surratt, were hanged at the gallows of the Old Penitentiary , on the site of present-day Fort McNair, on July 7, 1865.

Author: Tim Ott Updated: Jun 14, 2019 Original: Dec 13, 2018 Photo: MPI/Getty Images On April 9, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was paying a visit to Secretary of State William Henry Seward , injured in a carriage accident, when Secretary of War Edwin Stanton burst in with the news: Confederate General Robert E. Lee had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army earlier that day, ending the bloodiest conflict in American history. The following morning, after Stanton jolted the region awake with a 500-gun salute at dawn, the populace of Washington, D.C. took to the streets in celebration. A crowd of several thousand gathered outside the White House, clamoring for the President before he finally appeared in the second-story window to acknowledge their presence. Revealing that he planned to formally address the occasion in due time, Lincoln noted that he was particularly fond of the song \"Dixie,\" the anthem of the South, and asked the band assembled to strike up a version of the \"lawful prize\" acquired with the Union victory. Lincoln addressed Reconstruction in his final speech Just one day later, on April 11, Lincoln returned to that second-story window to deliver what would be his final prepared words to the public. After celebrating the success at hand, he pivoted to the crucial topic of Reconstruction, citing Louisiana as a state that had made good-faith efforts to offer freed slaves the opportunity for a public education. Although he was disappointed that voting rights were not part of the package, the President stressed that it was better to build on a flawed plan than to start from scratch, rhetorically asking whether a party \"shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it?” In the audience, actor and Southern sympathizer John Wilkes Booth seethed as he listened to ideas to reconfigure the fallen Confederacy. Having already launched a failed attempt to kidnap the President, he swore to colleagues that this time Lincoln would pay with his life. President Abraham Lincoln, his sons Thomas and Robert and his wife, Mary Photo: MPI/Getty Images The President spent his last day with his family Grant&aposs return to Washington brought more festivities and the chance for Lincoln to catch up with his oldest son, Robert , a captain on the general&aposs staff. They enjoyed a relaxed breakfast on the Good Friday morning of April 14, the elder imparting fatherly advice about the importance of finishing up law school. The President then attended his weekly cabinet meeting, which touched on the installation of a temporary military government in Virginia and North Carolina. But Lincoln seemed most eager to go out on a private carriage ride with his wife, Mary . Following a rough period in which they endured an all-encompassing war and the death of an 11-year-old son, the quiet excursion seemingly sparked an awakening from a winter&aposs discontent, as they revisited dormant memories and mused on the places they could visit together. Mary later told friends that she had never seen her husband so \"cheerful.\" SIGN UP FOR THE BIOGRAPHY.COM NEWSLETTER Against advice, Lincoln decided to attend the theater Following an early supper, the Lincolns prepared to attend a production of the comedy Our American Cousin at Ford&aposs Theatre. The Grants, initially scheduled to join them, wound up declining the invitation, as did Secretary Stanton, who chided the President on the dangers of appearing in such a public space. The President and First Lady were eventually accompanied by a younger couple, Clara Harris and Major Henry Rathbone. The play was already underway when the orchestra launched into \"Hail to the Chief,\" and Lincoln bowed to the applauding audience before settling into the presidential box with his party. Onlookers noted that Mary seemed quite cozy with her husband, often drawing his attention to something that caught her fancy on stage. Shortly after 10 p.m., Booth was allowed entry to the presidential box by an usher. With the policeman assigned to guard Lincoln nowhere in sight (accounts suggest he may have been in a neighboring tavern) the assassin had a clear path to his target. Waiting for a line that drew laughter, he quietly approached Lincoln and shot him in the back of the head. After Booth stabbed Rathbone and leaped from the box to the stage, igniting a pandemonium that many believed to be part of the production, attention turned to the President&aposs dire straits. The first to reach him was a recent medical school graduate named Charles Leale, who located the \"perfectly smooth opening\" of the bullet entry point and cleared out the mess of coagulated blood and matted hair to relieve pressure on Lincoln&aposs brain. Joined by two other doctors, they elected to move the mortally wounded patient from the crowded box. President Abraham Lincoln surrounded his friends and colleagues in bed following an assassination attempt Photo: Kean Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images A testament to his strength, Lincoln didn&apost die immediately Carried to the Petersen boardinghouse across the street, Lincoln was laid diagonally on a bed to accommodate his 6&apos4\" frame. Although the doctors seemed impressed by his superhuman ability to withstand a point-blank shot that would have killed most men immediately, they recognized the increasing futility of their attempts to remove the bullet. By midnight, the President&aposs cabinet had congregated around their leader, the somber mood further dampened by the (erroneous) report that Secretary of State Seward had also been assassinated. Robert attempted to console his distraught mother, even as he struggled to keep his own emotions in check. President Lincoln somehow hung on through dawn, but by then the onlookers were checking their watches against the faint breathing that occasionally broke the long spells of silence. When the inevitable arrived, at 7:22 a.m., Secretary Stanton aptly captured the moment before their grief spread from the room to the far territories of a war-torn country, remarking, \"Now, he belongs to the ages.\" By  Tim Ott Tim Ott has written for Biography and other A+E sites since 2012.

James M. Cornelius, Ph.D., Curator at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Museum, retells the events of that tragic day and its historic aftermath. Author: James M. Cornelius, Ph.D. Updated: Jun 14, 2019 Original: Apr 13, 2017 Abraham Lincoln portrait, 1863 (Photo: Alexander Gardner [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons) Abraham Lincoln , 16th president of the United States, was inaugurated on March 4, 1861 with military snipers guarding his procession route through Washington to the U.S. Capitol.  He had arrived in the city on February 23 by pre-dawn train, having snuck through Baltimore, Maryland, after detective Allan Pinkerton and others infiltrated a plot to kill Lincoln there.  His presidency was marked by a civil war begun by southern rebels on April 12. As early as May 1860, he had received hundreds of threatening letters at his home at Springfield, Illinois, after he received the Republican party&aposs nomination. John Wilkes Booth possibly knew of the Baltimore plot, but certainly planned to kidnap Lincoln at two points in 1864 and 1865, to force the release of rebel captives.  Conspirators living in or around Mary Surratt&aposs boarding house in Washington assisted with these plans, which failed.  When on Tuesday, April 11, 1865, two days after Appomattox, Lincoln gave a speech from the upper window of the White House to a crowd on the lawn below, Booth was present with Lewis Payne and David Herold to hear Lincoln suggest that voting rights ought now be extended to black men who were literate and/or had served in the Union military. \"That means nigger citizenship,\" said Booth to the others. \"That&aposs the last speech he&aposll ever give. By God, I&aposll put him through.\"  These words were reported later by both Payne and Herold to investigators.  Thus, Booth killed Lincoln specifically not because the South had lost the war as of April 9, but because Lincoln proposed black voting rights. Assassination of President Lincoln Booth&aposs plan took form on Good Friday, April 14, when he read in the afternoon newspapers that the Lincolns and the Grants would attend Ford&aposs Theatre that night to see Laura Keene&aposs benefit performance of the comedy Our American Cousin .  Booth carried a one-shot .44 derringer to kill Lincoln, and a 9-inch dagger to kill General Ulysses Grant .  But the Grants begged off the theater — Ulysses had not seen his four children in New Jersey for six months. When Booth entered the presidential box during the third act, just before the loudest laugh-line of the show, he probably did not know that the Grants&apos chairs were filled instead with Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Miss Clara Harris, daughter of a New York Senator.  During the laugh-line he shot Lincoln behind the left ear from about two feet away, then stabbed Rathbone down the left arm as they struggled, nearly causing Rathbone to die of blood loss.  Lincoln bled a little as Mary Lincoln screamed, but most of the copious blood shed in the box was Rathbone&aposs.  Ironically, had Grant attended, his personal guard would likely have barred Booth&aposs entry. Lincoln was carried to a bed across 10th Street in the home of William Petersen, where he died about nine hours later, at 7:22 a.m. on Saturday, April 15.  (Doctors said most men would have died within an hour or two from such a wound.)  Payne had tried to stab Secretary of State William H. Seward to death at his home while Booth was at Ford&aposs, but Seward and his son both barely survived; George Atzerodt, assigned to shoot Vice President Andrew Johnson at a hotel, failed to try.  Reports that another assassin approached Secretary of War Edwin Stanton&aposs home at the same hour have never been confirmed.  Booth was pursued for 12 days, and killed by Union cavalry on April 26 on a Virginia farm; Herold surrendered there but he and three other conspirators were tried publicly and hanged on July 7.  Four more of them got prison terms. A World in Mourning The shock to the nation and the world was immense; it was immediately called Black Easter.  (No Atlantic cable was working till 1866; so letters by steamship reached Europe on April 26, and telegrams quickly reached Asia and Africa from there; telegrams had reached Latin America much earlier.)  Americans had not thought that assassination was possible in a free and democratic republic, and faith in the stability of the society was shaken for a time.  Political revenge against the entire South was sought in Congress and elsewhere, and even rebel leader Jefferson Davis knew that the South had lost its best hope for peaceful reconstruction with Lincoln&aposs death. Black rights also suffered a setback for many years, perhaps decades, as President Andrew Johnson did not for the most part spur Congressional action or resist racist calls.  President Grant, in office 1869-1877, exerted himself strongly against the Ku Klux Klan and other resistance, in hopes of achieving his and Lincoln&aposs wishes for voting and citizen rights.  But the extremely close and drawn-out presidential election of November 1876 led to compromises that removed federal troops from most parts of the South, leaving enforcement of federal laws to reluctant or hostile local forces.  Invoking Lincoln&aposs name and his presumed, incomplete plans for postwar life met with increased resistance in the South as the decades wore on, animus which did not really disperse as a political force until the 1960s and 1970s. Lincoln&aposs funeral procession on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Library of Congress) Lincoln&aposs 12 public funerals, between Washington, D.C., and Springfield, Illinois, coupled with the passage of his funeral train through much of the North, drew somewhere between 8 and 10 million viewers or participants.  Those passing his open casket had an average of 1 second before guards hurried the line along.  These 15 days form the largest public event in human history, measured by active participation.  When in 1894 Czar Alexander III died in Crimea, authorities tried to re-create a Lincoln-style funeral-train passage through the Russian heartland to St. Petersburg, to engender public support as Lincoln&aposs train had done; the idea failed.  The story that Jackie Kennedy wished her slain husband President John F. Kennedy &aposs funeral procession in 1963 to \"be like Lincoln&aposs\" is unverified. Occurring at the acme of Lincoln&aposs achievement, his murder by a coward surely helped build the sense of his martyrdom and political genius.  Yet as new documents and interpretations continue to appear each year, the feeling remains that Lincoln&aposs acclaim was and is deserved, even if battling through political reconstruction after April 1865 might have gone slowly.  He saved the Union and ended slavery all at once, which in 1861 no one thought would or could happen. James M.

He realized his moment had arrived.     By 10:15 that evening, the comedy was well into its last act. In the Presidential Box, President and Mrs. Lincoln and their guests, Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée, Clara Harris, laughed at the show along with the audience—not knowing that Booth was just outside the door.   How could such a thing have taken place—and in Washington, the fortified capital of the nation? How did Booth gain such access to the theatre?  Why didn’t Lincoln’s security people stop him?  Was it a lone act or part of a larger conspiracy?  And, when all was said and done, what was the outcome—for those involved in the crime, for their victims, for the nation and even for Ford’s Theatre?   Conduct your own investigation below!

Yet on the morning of April 14, 1865, the President awoke in an uncommonly good mood. One day less than a week before, on Palm Sunday, April 9, Robert E. Lee, the commander of what remained of the Confederate States’ Army, surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, the commanding General of the Union. The truce reached at the Appomattox, Virginia, Court House signaled the end of the nation’s most destructive chapter, the Civil War.  To celebrate, Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln decided to attend the hit farce comedy “Our American Cousin,” which was playing at Ford’s Theatre. The Lincolns invited Gen. Grant and his wife to attend the play with them. At a cabinet meeting later that morning, however, Gen. Grant informed President Lincoln that they would not be able to join the first couple and, instead, would be visiting their children in New Jersey.  Even more ominous, the ornery Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, pleaded with the President not to go out that evening for fear of a potential assassination. Stanton was hardly the only presidential advisor against the outing. Mrs. Lincoln almost begged off, complaining of one of her all too frequent headaches. And even President Lincoln moaned about feeling exhausted as a result of his heavy presidential duties. Nevertheless, he insisted that an evening of comedy was just the tonic he and his wife required. Mr. Lincoln, confident that his bodyguards would protect him from any potential harm, shrugged off the warnings and invited Maj. Henry Rathbone and his fiancée, Clara Harris, to join them for a night at the theater.  Lithograph of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Rathbone is depicted as spotting Booth before he shot Lincoln and trying to stop him as Booth fired his weapon. From the Library of Congress  Lincoln’s main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon did not attend the play and, instead, John Parker, a police guard well known for his love of whisky, protected the president. Parker left his post outside the presidential box during intermission to satisfy an alcoholic craving at the nearby Star Saloon.  The Derringer pistol used by John Wilkes Booth to shoot Abraham Lincoln. Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images  During the third act, as the Lincolns laughed and held hands, a man barged into the unguarded box. The intruder, of course, was the actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. The assassin discharged his Derringer pistol into the back of Lincoln’s head. Major Rathbone tried to tackle Booth down but the assassin overpowered him by slashing his arm with a dagger. Historians, as they are wont to do, bicker over whether Booth yelled “Sic Semper Tyrannis!” (“Thus always to tyrants!”) before or shortly after he shot the president (Aside from the controversy over the timing of Booth’s exclamation, some have claimed he said “The South is Avenged!”, “Revenge for the South!” or even “I have done it!”) We do know that Booth jumped from the box to the stage, caught his spur in the curtain, and may have broken his left shin (another source of contention among historians). He somehow managed to limp away and exit through the stage door, thus initiating one of the most intense manhunts in American history.  When it comes to medical history, however, it is not Booth’s injured limb that captures our imagination. Instead, it is the hours of agony the wounded president endured before finally succumbing early on the morning on April 15.  As members of the audience cried out that the president had been murdered and shouted pleas to catch and kill the escaping culprit, the first doctor to attend Lincoln was a 23-year-old Army captain named Charles A. Leale. He had just received his medical degree six weeks earlier, on March 1, from the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York, widely regarded as one of the best in the nation. Leale was in the audience that evening after he learned that Lincoln, who he greatly admired, would be at Ford’s Theatre.  Ford’s Theatre, with guards posted at the entrance and crepe draped from windows, circa 1865. Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images  Dr. Leale immediately discerned, by sense of touch along the bloody wound, that the bullet had entered the president’s head just behind his left ear and tore its way through the left side of his brain. Sending out for some brandy and water, Dr. Leale recalled, “When I reached the president he was in a state of general paralysis, his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous (i.e., noisy and laborious). I placed my finger on his right radial pulse but could perceive no movement of the artery.”  While examining Lincoln’s head, Leale’s fingers passed over a “large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone” (at the rear base of the skull). The young physician removed the clot, wiggled his little finger into the hole made by the “ball” (the name for the round bullets then in use in the 1860s), and found that it had made its way into the brain. This maneuver may seem shocking to a 21st century observer but in the days before doctors knew anything about microbiology, let alone sterile surgical technique, it was a common practice for examining gunshot wounds. Dr. Leale quickly determined that this was a mortal wound.  After a few minutes, Lincoln’s breathing seemed to rally a bit and Dr. Leale was able to get a bit of the brandy and water down the president’s mouth. By this time, two other doctors, C.F. Taft and A.F.A. King arrived to the scene and the three of them decided to move the moribund president across the street to William and Anna Petersen’s boarding house , at 453 10th St. (now 516 10th St.) There, he was taken upstairs to rest in the room of a Union soldier named William T. Clark, who was out for the evening.  The macabre details of Lincoln’s last hours became far clearer in 2012 when Helena Iles Papaioannou, a research assistant working on the Papers of Abraham Lincoln Project, was searching through the “Letters Received” ledgers of the Office of the Surgeon General , which are deposited at the U.S. National Archives. It was in these files, under the letter “L,” that she found a 22-page report Dr. Leale wrote only a few hours after President Lincoln died. In fact, there are seven extant accounts by Leale, five dating from 1865, one from 1867, and another from 1909. Each version is similar, albeit each contains some variations and slight differences of terminology and tone. Yet many Lincoln scholars have deemed the Papaioannou document to be the most reliable version because it was written so closely after the actual events.  The room in which President Abraham Lincoln died, in the Petersen House in Washington, D.C., just across the street from Ford’s Theatre, circa 1960. The bed is a replica; the actual deathbed was acquired by the Chicago History Museum in 1920. Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images  Given President Lincoln’s legendary height, he was placed on the bed in a diagonal position with “a part of the foot (of the bed) removed to enable us to place him in a comfortable position.” The windows of the room were opened and, with the exception of the physicians attending the president, his wife and son Robert, and several of President’s Lincoln’s closest advisors, the tiny room was cleared. The surgeons attempted to probe the wound by introducing surgical instruments (and their unwashed hands) into the bullet hole with the hope of extracting the lead ball and dislodged pieces of bone. Surgery of the brain being an all but non-existent medical specialty at this point in history, the doctors’ only hope was that by keeping the wound open, the blood might flow more freely and not further compress the brain, causing even more injury. Sadly, their efforts were to no avail, and as the morning hours proceeded, Lincoln’s course only went downhill.  Dr. Leale wrote: At 7:20 a.m. he breathed his last and “the spirit fled to God who gave it.” Photo from National Archives  At 6:40 a.m., Dr. Leale wrote, “his pulse could not be counted, it being very intermittent, two or three pulsations being felt and followed by an intermission, when not the slightest movement of the artery could be felt. The inspirations now became very short, and the expirations very prolonged and labored accompanied by a guttural sound.”  At 6:50 a.m., Dr. Leale again recorded what he observed: “The respirations cease for some time and all eagerly look at their watches until the profound silence is disturbed by a prolonged inspiration, which was soon followed by a sonorous expiration. The Surgeon General (Joseph K. Barnes) now held his finger to the carotid artery, Col. (Charles) Crane held his head, Dr. (Robert) Stone (the Lincoln’s family physician) who was sitting on the bed, held his left pulse, and his right pulse was held by myself.  “At 7:20 a.m.,” he wrote, “he breathed his last and (here, Leale paraphrases Ecclesiastes 12:7) ‘the spirit fled to God who gave it.’” (Most historians give the time of death at 7:22 a.m.)  More famously, Secretary of War Stanton saluted the fallen president and famously uttered, “Now, he belongs to the ages.” (Some have argued that Stanton said “Now, he belongs to the angels.”) Stanton further eulogized President Lincoln with the apt observation, “There lies the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen.”  In a strange way, the events of April 14 and 15 represented the incarnation of Lincoln’s worst nightmare. Just three days before his death, Abraham Lincoln told bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon that he had a dream about a funeral that took place in the East Room of the White House. In the dream he asked a soldier posted near the casket, “Who is dead?” The soldier replied, “The President, killed by an assassin!” The President also noted, “Then came a loud burst of grief from the crowd, which woke me from my dream. I slept no more that night; and although it was only a dream, I have been strangely annoyed by it ever since.”  Dr. Leale went on to a distinguished career as a physician, after an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army in 1866 as “brevet captain.” He travelled to Europe and studied cholera during the great cholera pandemic of 1866. He married in 1867, fathered six children, successfully practiced medicine and worked on a number of charitable causes in New York City until his retirement in 1928 at the age of 86. But his greatest medical adventure occurred a mere few weeks after receiving his medical degree. That was the night and day, 150 years ago, when Dr. Leale took care of the 16th President of the United States, who drew his final breath early on the morning of April 15, 1865, because of the deranged act of a mad assassin.

            "              | Subscribe    April 8, 2015         Good Friday, April 14, 1865, was surely one of Abraham Lincoln’s happiest days. The morning began with a leisurely breakfast in the company of his son Robert, just arrived in Washington after serving on General Grant’s staff. “Well, my son, you have returned safely from the front,” Lincoln said. “The war is now closed, and we soon will live in peace with the brave men that have been fighting against us.” He urged Robert to “lay aside” his Army uniform and finish his education, perhaps in preparation for a law career. As the father imparted his advice, Mary Lincoln’s seamstress, Elizabeth Keckley, observed, “His face was more cheerful than [she] had seen it for a long while.”   From This Story      Special Anniversary Issue  Buy     At 11 a.m., Grant arrived at the White House to attend the regularly scheduled Friday cabinet meeting. He had hoped for word that Gen. Joseph E. Johnston’s army, the last substantial Rebel force remaining, had surrendered in North Carolina, but no news had yet arrived. Lincoln told Grant not to worry. He predicted that the tidings would come soon, “for he had last night the usual dream which he had preceding nearly every great and important event of the War.” Gideon Welles asked him to describe the dream. Turning toward him, Lincoln said it involved the Navy secretary’s “element, the water—that he seemed to be in some singular, indescribable vessel, and that he was moving with great rapidity towards an indefinite shore; that he had this dream preceding Sumter, Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, Stone River, Vicksburg, Wilmington, etc.” Grant remarked that not all those great events had been victories, but Lincoln remained hopeful that this time this event would be favorable.  The complexities of re-establishing law and order in the Southern states dominated the conversation. A few days earlier, War Secretary Edwin Stanton had drafted a plan for imposing a temporary military government on Virginia and North Carolina, until the restoration of civilian rule. “Lincoln alluded to the paper,” Stanton later recalled, “went into his room, brought it out and asked me to read it.” A general discussion revealed that most of the cabinet concurred, although Welles and Postmaster General William Dennison objected to the idea of undoing state boundaries by uniting two different states into a single military department. Recognizing the validity of this objection, Lincoln asked Stanton to revise his plan to make it applicable to two separate states.         Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln   Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.  Buy    Lincoln said that “he thought it providential that this great rebellion was crushed just as Congress had adjourned,” since he and the cabinet were more likely to “accomplish more without them than with them” regarding Reconstruction. He noted that “there were men in Congress who, if their motives were good, were nevertheless impracticable, and who possessed feelings of hate and vindictiveness in which he did not sympathize and could not participate. He hoped there would be no persecution, no bloody work, after the war was over.”  As for the Rebel leaders, Lincoln reiterated his resolve to perpetrate no further violence: “None need expect he would take any part in hanging or killing those men, even the worst of them.” While their continued presence on American soil might prove troublesome, he preferred to “frighten them out of the country, open the gates, let down the bars, scare them off.” To illustrate his point, he shook “his hands as if scaring sheep,” and said, “Enough lives have been sacrificed. We must extinguish our resentments if we expect harmony and union.”  After the cabinet meeting, Stanton and Attorney General James Speed descended the stairs together. “Didn’t our Chief look grand today?” Stanton asked. Years later, Speed held fast “to the memory of Lincoln’s personal appearance” that day, “with cleanly-shaved face, well-brushed clothing and neatly-combed hair and whiskers,” a marked contrast to his usual rumpled aspect. Stanton later wrote that Lincoln seemed “more cheerful and happy” than at any previous cabinet meeting, thrilled by “the near prospect of firm and durable peace at home and abroad.” Throughout the discussion, Stanton recalled, Lincoln “spoke very kindly of General Lee and others of the Confederacy,” exhibiting “in marked degree the kindness and humanity of his disposition, and the tender and forgiving spirit that so eminently distinguished him.”  Later that day, Lincoln put into practice his liberal policy toward the Rebel leaders. Intelligence had reached Stanton at the War Department that “a conspicuous secessionist,” Jacob Thompson, was en route to Portland, Maine, where a steamer awaited to take him to England. Operating from Canada, Thompson had organized a series of troublesome raids across the border that left Stanton with little sympathy for the Confederate marauder. Upon reading the telegram, Stanton did not hesitate a moment. “Arrest him!” he ordered Assistant Secretary Charles Dana. As Dana was leaving the room, however, Stanton called him back. “No, wait; better to go over and see the President.”  Dana found Lincoln in his office. “Halloo, Dana!” Lincoln greeted him. “What’s up?” Dana described the situation, explaining that Stanton wanted to arrest Thompson but thought he should first “refer the question” to Lincoln. “Well,” said Lincoln, “no, I rather think not. When you have got an elephant by the hind leg, and he’s trying to run away, it’s best to let him run.”  Mary Lincoln’s memories of her husband’s infectious happiness that day match the recollections of his inner circle. She had never seen him so “cheerful,” she told the painter Francis Carpenter, “his manner was even playful. At 3 o’clock, in the afternoon, he drove out with me in the open carriage, in starting, I asked him, if any one, should accompany us, he immediately replied—‘No—I prefer to ride by ourselves to day.’ During the drive he was so gay, that I said to him, laughingly, ‘Dear Husband, you almost startle me by your great cheerfulness,’ he replied, ‘and well I may feel so, Mary, I consider this day, the war, has come to a close—and then added, ‘We must both, be more cheerful in the future—between the war & the loss of our darling Willie—we have both, been very miserable.’”  As the carriage rolled toward the Navy Yard, Mary recalled, “he spoke of his old Springfield home, and recollections of his early days, his little brown cottage, the law office, the courtroom, the green bag for his briefs and law papers, his adventures when riding the circuit.” They had traveled an unimaginable distance together since their first dance in Springfield a quarter of a century earlier. Over the years, they had supported each other, irritated each other, shared a love of family, politics, poetry and drama. Mary’s descent into depression after their son Willie’s death had added immeasurably to Lincoln’s burdens, and the terrible pressures of the war had further distorted their relationship. His intense focus on his presidential responsibilities had often left her feeling abandoned and resentful. Now, with the war coming to an end and time bringing solace to their grief, the Lincolns could plan for a happier future. They hoped to travel someday—to Europe and the Holy Land, over the Rockies to California, then back home to Illinois, where their life together had begun.  As the carriage neared the White House, Lincoln saw that a group of old friends, including Illinois Gov. Richard Oglesby, were just leaving. “Come back, boys, come back,” he told them, relishing the relaxing company of friends. They remained for some time, Oglesby recalled. “Lincoln got to reading some humorous book; I think it was by ‘John Phoenix.’ They kept sending for him to come to dinner. He promised each time to go, but would continue reading the book. Finally he got a sort of peremptory order that he must come to dinner at once.”  The early dinner was necessary, for the Lincolns had plans to see Laura Keene in Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theatre that evening. After supper, the president met with journalist Noah Brooks, Massachusetts Congressman George Ashmun and House Speaker Schuyler Colfax, who was soon to depart for California. “How I would rejoice to make that trip!” Lincoln told Colfax, “but public duties chain me down here, and I can only envy you its pleasures.” The president invited Colfax to join him at the theater that night, but Colfax had too many commitments.  To Brooks, Lincoln had never seemed “more hopeful and buoyant concerning the condition of the country....He was full of fun and anecdotes, feeling especially jubilant at the prospect before us.” His parting words, Brooks recalled, focused on the country’s economic future. “Grant thinks that we can reduce the cost of the Army establishment at least a half million a day, which, with the reduction of expenditures of the Navy, will soon bring down our national debt to something like decent proportions, and bring our national paper up to a par, or nearly so with gold.”  Speaker Colfax was among several people who declined the Lincolns’ invitation to the theater that evening. The morning edition of the National Republican had announced that the Grants would join the Lincolns in the president’s box that night, but Julia Grant had her heart set on visiting their children in New Jersey, so Grant asked to be excused. The Stantons also declined. Stanton considered the theater a foolish diversion and, more important, a dangerous one. He had fought a losing battle for months to keep the president from such public places, and he felt that his presence would only sanction an unnecessary hazard. Earlier that day, “unwilling to encourage the theater project,” Stanton had refused to let his chief telegrapher, Thomas Eckert, accept Lincoln’s invitation, even though the president had teasingly requested him for his uncommon strength—he had been known to “break a poker over his arm” and could serve as a bodyguard.  It was after 8 when the Lincolns entered their carriage to drive to the theater. “I suppose it’s time to go,” Lincoln told Colfax, “though I would rather stay.” While nothing had provided greater diversion during the bitter nights of his presidency than the theater, Lincoln required no escape on this happy night. Still, he had made a commitment. “It has been advertised that we will be there,” he told his bodyguard, William Crook, who had the night off, “and I cannot disappoint the people.” Clara Harris—the daughter of Mary’s friend Senator Ira Harris—and her fiancé, Maj. Henry Rathbone, joined the Lincolns in their carriage.  As the Lincolns rode to Ford’s Theatre on Tenth Street, John Wilkes Booth and three conspirators were a block away, at the Herndon House. Booth had devised a plan that called for the simultaneous assassinations of President Lincoln, Secretary of State William Henry Seward and Vice President Andrew Johnson. Having learned that morning of Lincoln’s plan to attend the theater, he had decided that this night would provide their best opportunity. The powerfully built Lewis Powell, accompanied by David Herold, was assigned to kill Seward at his Lafayette Square home. Meanwhile, the carriage maker George Atzerodt was to shoot the vice president in his suite at the Kirkwood Hotel. Booth, whose familiarity with the stagehands would ensure access, would assassinate the president.  Just as Brutus had been honored for slaying the tyrant Julius Caesar, Booth believed he would be exalted for killing an even “greater tyrant.” Assassinating Lincoln would not be enough. “Booth knew,” his biographer Michael W. Kauffman observes, “that in the end, the Brutus conspiracy was foiled by Marc Antony, whose famous oration made outlaws of the assassins and a martyr of Caesar.” William Henry Seward, Lincoln’s Marc Antony, must not live. Finally, to throw the entire North into disarray, the vice president must die as well. The triple assassinations were set for 10:15 p.m.  Still bedridden, Seward had enjoyed his best day since his nearly fatal carriage accident nine days earlier. His daughter Fanny Seward noted in her diary that he had slept well the previous night and had taken “solid food for the first time.” In the afternoon, he had “listened with a look of pleasure to the narrative of the events of the Cabinet meeting,” which Fred Seward, as assistant secretary, had attended in his father’s stead. Later in the afternoon, he had listened to Fanny’s reading of “Enoch Arden” and remarked on how much he enjoyed it.  The three-story house was full of people. The entire family, except Will and Jenny, were there—his wife, Frances, and their other children, Augustus, Fred, Anna and Fanny. In addition to the half-dozen household servants and the State Department messenger rooming on the third floor, two soldiers had been assigned by Stanton to stay with Seward. In the early evening, Stanton had stopped by to check on his friend and colleague. He stayed for a while, chatting with other visitors until martial music in the air reminded him that War Department employees had planned on serenading him that night at his home six blocks away.  After all the guests left, “the quiet arrangements for the night” began. To ensure that Seward was never left alone, the family members had taken turns sitting by his bed. That night Fanny was scheduled to stay with him until 11 p.m., when her brother Gus would relieve her. George Robinson, one of the soldiers whom Stanton had detailed to the household, was standing by. Shortly after 10 p.m., Fanny noticed that her father was falling asleep. She closed the pages of the Legends of Charlemagne, turned down the gas lamps, and took a seat on the opposite side of the bed.  Fred Seward later wrote that “there seemed nothing unusual in the occurrence, when a tall, well dressed, but unknown man presented himself” at the door. Powell told the servant who answered the bell that he had some medicine for Mr. Seward and had been instructed by his physician to deliver it in person. “I told him he could not go up,” the servant later testified, “that if he would give me the medicine, I would tell Mr. Seward how to take it.” Powell was so insistent that the boy stepped aside. When he reached the landing, Fred Seward stopped him. “My father is asleep; give me the medicine and the directions; I will take them to him.” Powell argued that he must deliver it in person, but Fred refused.  At this point, Fred recalled, the intruder “stood apparently irresolute.” He began to head down the stairs, then “suddenly turning again, he sprang up and forward, having drawn a Navy revolver, which he levelled, with a muttered oath, at my head, and pulled the trigger.” This was the last memory Fred would have of that night. The pistol misfired, but Powell brought it down so savagely that Fred’s skull was crushed in two places, exposing his brain and rendering him unconscious.  Hearing the disturbance, Pvt. Robinson ran to the door from Seward’s bedside. The moment the door was opened, Powell rushed inside, brandishing his now broken pistol in one hand and a large knife in the other. He slashed Robinson in the forehead with his knife, knocking him “partially down,” and headed toward Seward. Fanny ran beside Powell, begging him not to kill her father. When Seward heard the word “kill,” he awakened, affording him “one glimpse of the assassin’s face bending over” before the large bowie knife plunged into his neck and face, severing his cheek so badly that “the flap hung loose on his neck.” Oddly, he would later recall that his only impressions were what a fine-looking man Powell was and “what handsome cloth that overcoat is made of.”  Fanny’s screams brought her brother Gus into the room as Powell advanced again upon Seward, who had been knocked to the floor by the force of the blows. Gus and the injured Robinson managed to pull Powell away, but not before he struck Robinson again and slashed Gus on the forehead and the right hand. When Gus ran for his pistol, Powell bolted down the stairs, stabbing Emerick Hansell, the young State Department messenger, in the back before he bolted out the door and fled through the city streets.

I should know. I’ve been making disappointing anniversary pilgrimages to the scene for more than a quarter of a century. My first was in 1987, during my first spring in Washington, D.C., when my future wife and I were serving in the Reagan administration. After work, we walked to the then-seedy neighborhood surrounding Ford’s Theatre and discovered Geraldine’s House of Beef, a restaurant whose only attraction was a table near the front window that offered a clear view of Ford’s facade on Tenth Street NW. We decided to have dinner while we waited to see what would happen. Of course, we thought, a crowd would arrive soon to honor the most beloved president in American history. No doubt the National Park Service, which has administered Ford’s since 1933, would hold a solemn ceremony.  Nine p.m., nothing. Ten p.m.—about 20 minutes before the moment John Wilkes Booth fired his single-shot Deringer pistol at the back of the president’s head and changed the nation’s destiny—nothing. Then we saw movement. A station wagon turned onto Tenth Street. In it was a picture-postcard American family—two parents and two young children, a boy and a girl. As the car slowed and coasted past, the driver pointed out the window to the theater. The kids’ heads swiveled to their left and nodded up and down. The car drove on.  That was it. That was how the American people honored Abraham Lincoln on the night and at the place of his assassination. I did not realize it then, but that was the moment that would lead me to write my book Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer .  On all the April 14ths that followed, nothing changed at Ford’s. Far from inviting people to sit vigil, the National Park Service’s security guards and police discouraged nighttime anniversary visitors. In 2013, I almost got arrested trying to honor Lincoln.  Around 9 p.m. I sat, as had become my habit, on the front steps of the Petersen House, the boardinghouse where Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865. It, too, is administered by the National Park Service as part of the assassination historical site. I imagined the theater doors across the way bursting open and the shouting, frenzied audience of 1,500 flooding Tenth Street. I could see in my mind’s eye the unconscious president as he was carried into the street. I pictured how a Petersen House resident opened the door at the top of the staircase and shouted, “Bring him in here!” and how the soldiers carried him past the very spot where I sat.  Across the street, a guard inside Ford’s Theatre pushed open a plexiglass door next to her security desk and bellowed: “Get off those steps! You can’t sit there. That’s private property. I’ll call the police.” I got up and crossed the street. I explained to her that tonight was the anniversary of Lincoln’s assassination. That I served on the advisory council of the Ford’s Theatre Society. That I had written a book about what had happened. And those steps, I couldn’t resist reminding her, belonged to the American people.  She gaped at me, uncomprehending. I returned to the Petersen House and sat down. Ten minutes later, two park service police cars pulled up. The three cops said that Officer Johnson had reported a hostile homeless man lurking about. “Lots of men sit on these steps and urinate on the house,” said one of the officers. “How do we know you’re not going to do that? You’ve got no right to sit here.” After much tense discussion, another officer rolled his eyes and advised me to enjoy the evening.  Last year, I brought two friends along as reinforcements. The country was in the middle of celebrating the 2011-15 Civil War sesquicentennial. Surely that would bring people out. But no. Fewer than ten people showed up. I posted a disappointed report on Twitter. And received no comments.  Things promise to be different this April 14, the 150th anniversary of the assassination. The Ford’s Theatre Society and the park service will transform Tenth Street into a time tunnel that will transport visitors back to the sights and sounds of 1865. Starting the morning of April 14, the street will be closed to traffic. Ford’s will stay open for 36 hours straight to accommodate a schedule of short history plays, readings, musical performances and moments of silence. Street vendors will hawk small paper flags celebrating the fall of Richmond and the effective end of the Civil War, just as they did in 1865, right up to the moment of the assassination.  And at 10:20 p.m., all will go silent, until a bugler playing taps breaks the spell. Then, for the first time in 150 years, mourners will hold a torchlight vigil in front of the Petersen House. I will be there too, marking the climax of a lifelong fascination with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  I was born on February 12, Lincoln’s birthday. From childhood, I received books and souvenirs about him as gifts. When I was 10, my grandmother presented me with an engraving of Booth’s Deringer. Framed with it was a clipping cut from the Chicago Tribune the day Lincoln died. But the story was incomplete, ending in mid-sentence. I hung it on my bedroom wall and reread it hundreds of times during my childhood, often thinking, “I want to know the rest of the story.” I still have it today.  On weekends I begged my parents to take me to the old Chicago Historical Society so I could visit its most prized relic, Lincoln’s deathbed. I longed to go to Washington to visit Ford’s Theatre, and my father took me with him on a business trip there. That boyhood curiosity turned me into an obsessive lifelong collector of original Lincoln assassination documents, photographs and artifacts.  And years later, it led to the books: Manhunt ; its sequel, Bloody Crimes ; and even a book for young adults, Chasing Lincoln’s Killer . I could not have written them without my personal archive. In fact, I think of myself as a crazed collector who happens to write books. My collection contains magical objects that resonate with meaning. They don’t just reflect history; they are history. For the 150th anniversary, I’ve picked out my favorite Lincoln assassination relics—from my collection and others—that best bring alive what Walt Whitman called that “moody, tearful night.”             Ford's Theatre playbill (Cade Martin)    Ford’s Theatre Playbill  On the morning of Friday, April 14, 1865, Mary Lincoln notified Ford’s Theatre that she and the president would attend that night’s performance of Our American Cousin . That pleased Laura Keene. The show was a “benefit” for the star actress; she would share in the profits, which would presumably grow as word of the first couple’s plans spread. A few blocks away, on D Street near Seventh, H. Polkinhorn & Son printed a playbill—something to hand out on the street that day to drum up ticket sales. But that night’s events invested this common-place piece of theatrical ephemera with unparalleled significance: It freezes a snapshot of the “before.”  For me, the playbill conjures the opening scenes from one of Lincoln’s happiest nights: the presidential carriage arriving on Tenth Street, and inside the theater the sound of cheers, “Hail to the Chief,” laughter and hissing gaslights. It also resonates with eerie foreboding, symbolizing not only Lincoln’s death, but also the end of Ford’s Theatre, which would go dark for more than a century. Lincoln loved theater, and coming to Ford’s. Whenever I leave my house to go there, where I often attend performances and other events, I always glance at the playbill hanging in my hallway. It reminds me that Ford’s is not just a place of death. Lincoln laughed there, too.            His hat bore a mourning band for his son Willie, who had died in 1862. (Cade Martin)             The coat Lincoln wore to Ford’s Theatre was made for his second inauguration. (Cade Martin)    Lincoln’s Top Hat and Overcoat  Nothing from the president’s wardrobe more potently symbolizes his identity than his top hat. Lincoln adopted one as his trademark back in Illinois, when he was a lawyer, long before he came to Washington. He chose unusually tall hats to attract attention and accentuate his height. At 6-foot-4, Lincoln already towered over most of his contemporaries; his hat made him look like a seven-foot giant. This is the hat that he wore on April 14, and that he doffed when he stood in the President’s Box at Ford’s and bowed to acknowledge the jubilant audience of his fellow citizens.  Lincoln’s signature color was black, and throughout his presidency he wore a white shirt, black pants and a thigh-length frock coat. And the night he went to Ford’s Theatre, he wore a custom-made black wool Brooks Brothers overcoat trimmed at the collar, lapels and cuffs with grosgrain piping. The black silk quilted lining was stitched with the outline of a large American eagle, a shield of stars and stripes and the motto “One Country, One Destiny.” How eerily appropriate that when Lincoln was murdered, his body was draped in a garment writ large with the words for which he gave his life.           After Booth’s shot stopped the play in the third act, Laura Keene made her way to Lincoln’s side (her blood-stained costume). (Cade Martin)    Swatch of Laura Keene’s Costume  After Booth fled Ford’s, Laura Keene raced from the stage to the President’s Box, where she discovered that Dr. Charles Leale had laid Lincoln on the floor. She knelt beside the unconscious, dying president and cradled his head in her lap. Blood and brain matter oozed from the bullet wound onto her silken costume, staining its festive red, yellow, green and blue floral pattern. Like a Victorian bride who lovingly preserved her wedding dress, Keene cherished her frock from this terrible night. But it soon became an object of morbid curiosity—strangers tried to cut swatches as gruesome keepsakes—and she eventually exiled the haunted relic into her family’s care. The dress vanished long ago, but miraculously five swatches survived. For more than a century, they have been legendary among collectors. The whereabouts of this example had been unknown until it surfaced in the late 1990s, and I acquired it. This one, according to an accompanying letter of provenance from Keene’s grandson, was presented to a longtime family friend. The gay floral pattern remains almost as bright as the day the dress was made more than 150 years ago in Chicago by dressmaker Jamie Bullock. But the red bloodstains faded long ago to a pale rust-brown.  When I was working on Manhunt , I never let this swatch out of my sight while I wrote the scene describing what happened in the President’s Box after the shooting. As I stared at this blood relic, I saw it all, and the paragraphs wrote themselves.            This vintage print shows the bed and linens in the Petersen House bedroom where Lincoln died. The photo was taken the day after the assassination by two Petersen House boarders, brothers Henry and Julius Ulke. (Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation)    Lincoln’s Deathbed  At 7:22 and 10 seconds a.m. on April 15, after an all-night vigil, Abraham Lincoln died in a back room at the Petersen House on a bed that was too small for his frame. The doctors had had to lay him diagonally atop the mattress. Soldiers wrapped his naked body in an American flag and put him into a plain pine box—a rectangular military crate. Lincoln, the former rail-splitter, would not have minded so simple a coffin. After they took him home to the White House, sheets, pillows, towels and a coverlet lay on the boardinghouse bed, still wet with the president’s blood. Two Petersen House boarders, brothers Henry and Julius Ulke, one a photographer and the other an artist, set up a tripod camera and, with the morning sun flooding the hallway from the front door all the way back to the little rear room, photographed the scene.           “A hippodrome of sorrow,” one writer called Lincoln’s final journey. A lock of hair clipped by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton at the president’s deathbed. (Cade Martin)    Lock of Lincoln’s Hair  Within an hour after the assassination, Mary Lincoln summoned Mary Jane Welles to the Petersen House. Mary Jane, the wife of Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, was one of Mary’s few friends in Washington. They had bonded over shared sadness: In 1862, Mary Jane had helped nurse 11-year-old Willie Lincoln until he died of typhoid fever; the next year, the Welleses lost their 3-year-old son to diphtheria. On the morning of April 15, Lincoln’s death room emptied of mourners (including Gideon Welles) save one: War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton, whom Lincoln called his “Mars, God of War.” Stanton was an imperious and widely feared cabinet secretary, but he had loved the president, and the assassination was for him a profound personal tragedy. Alone with his fallen chief, Stanton cut a generous lock of the president’s hair and sealed it in a plain white envelope. He knew who deserved the memento. After signing his name on the envelope, he addressed it “For Mrs. Welles.” When she received it later that day, she inscribed the envelope in pencil in her own small, neat hand: “Lock of Mr. Lincoln’s hair April 15, 1865, M.J.W.”  She mounted the lock in an oval gold frame, along with dried flowers she collected from Lincoln’s coffin at the April 19 White House funeral. The card securing the relics in place behind their glass cover was calligraphed to testify that they were “Sacred to the Memory of Abraham Lincoln 16th President of the United States.” This isn’t the only surviving lock of Lincoln’s hair. Mary Lincoln claimed one, as did several of the doctors present at the Petersen House or his autopsy. Others were purloined from Lincoln’s head, and one wonders how he made it to the grave with any hair at all. But the Stanton/Welles lock, with its unparalleled provenance and interwoven tales of love and loss, is perhaps the most evocative one of all.            War Secretary Stanton proclaimed a $100,000 reward for the capture of Booth. (Cade Martin)    $100,000 Reward Poster  Today, it is the most famous reward poster in American history. In 1865, it was the symbol of a failing, increasingly desperate manhunt. And when I was 19 years old, it was my first important acquisition. I had coveted one of these posters since I was 10, and when I was a sophomore at the University of Chicago I spotted one in a book dealer’s catalog and ordered it at once. I bought the poster instead of a used car.  Booth shot Lincoln in front of 1,500 witnesses, escaped from Ford’s Theatre, galloped away on a horse and vanished to parts unknown. The failure of several thousand pursuers to hunt down Lincoln’s assassin had become an embarrassment to the government. On April 20, six days after the assassination, War Secretary Stanton proclaimed a $100,000 reward for the capture of Booth and two of his alleged accomplices. It was a staggering sum—the average worker was earning about $1 a day—and the War Department printed broadsides to publicize it. Every penny of the blood money was paid, divided among a few dozen of the pursuers most credited for the capture or death of John Wilkes Booth and his accomplices.            The 12-day manhunt for Booth unleashed a torrent of anger (a defaced portrait) and ended in reprisal. (Cade Martin)    Defaced Photograph  The day after the assassination, technicians at the Surgeon General’s photo laboratory copied a popular carte-de-visite photo of Booth and printed multiple examples for distribution to the assassin’s pursuers. This copy was issued to William Bender Wilson, a telegraph operator at the War Department who was in the field during the manhunt. Wilson inscribed its provenance on the back of the card: “This picture of J. Wilkes Booth was given to me from the War Department at Washington, D.C. whilst Booth was still a fugitive. Wm. B. Wilson.” Upon learning of Booth’s death, Wilson expressed his contempt for the murderer by defacing his image with a handwritten message: “...for the cause he said was a righteous one. No! Cowardly murder suited him better. And this is Chivalry is it? Like a viper he lived—like a dog died, and like a dog buried. ‘Assassin.’ ‘Booth the accursed.’” Few other relics preserve so well the passions unleashed in April 1865.           The bullet that killed Lincoln. (Cade Martin)    The Bullet That Killed Lincoln  Booth fired a lead ball at Lincoln’s head. The bullet entered below the president’s left ear, bored diagonally through his brain and stopped behind his right eye. Lincoln never regained consciousness. No autopsy was necessary to determine the cause of death, but it would have been obscene to bury the president of the United States with a bullet in his brain. It had to be dug out. Edward Curtis, an assistant surgeon at the autopsy, described the hideous work: “I proceeded to open the head and remove the brain down to the track of the ball. Not finding it readily, we proceeded to remove the entire brain, when, as I was lifting the latter from the cavity of the skull, suddenly the bullet dropped out through my fingers and fell, breaking the solemn silence of the room with its clatter, into an empty basin that was standing beneath. There it lay upon the white china, a little black mass no bigger than the end of my finger—dull, motionless and harmless, yet the cause of such mighty changes in the world’s history as we may perhaps never realize.” Whenever I visit this bullet at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Maryland, I hear its echo in the basin.           Booth had two Colt pistols (including this one) and a Spencer repeating carbine with him when he confronted the Union party that pursued him to the Garrett farm in Virginia. (Cade Martin)    Booth’s Arsenal  Booth’s Deringer is just one of several arms he purchased for his March 1865 plot to kidnap the president and soon deployed in his plot to kill Lincoln. Booth had two Colt revolvers and a Spencer repeating carbine with him when he was killed. He had issued a revolver and knife to George Atzerodt, who was supposed to murder Vice President Andrew Johnson. (Atzerodt got drunk and ran away, throwing the blade into the street and selling the pistol at a Georgetown shop.) Booth lent a knife and Whitney revolver to Lewis Powell, who made a bloody but failed attempt to kill Secretary of State William Seward. (Powell broke the pistol on the skull of one of Seward’s sons and used the knife to stab Seward nearly to death, along with several other members of his household.) Along with his Deringer, Booth carried into Ford’s Theatre a Rio Grande camp knife, which he used to stab Lincoln’s guest Maj. Henry Rathbone in the theater box, and which, after he leapt to the stage, he thrust above his head for all the audience to see as he shouted, “ Sic semper tyrannis ” (“Thus always to tyrants”). The audience was too far away to read the mottoes acid-etched onto the blood-smeared blade: “Land of the Free/Home of the Brave”; “Liberty/Independence.” How strange that the president and his assassin both embraced those sentiments.  ​           “Our country owed all our troubles to [Lincoln], and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment,” Booth wrote in the pocket calendar he carried during the 12 days he was a fugitive. (Cade Martin)    Booth’s “Diary”  Contrary to popular belief, Booth never kept a “diary” of the Lincoln assassination. During the manhunt he carried a small bound pocket calendar for the year 1864, which contained several blank pages, and on those sheets he wrote several notorious entries. To read them today is to encounter the mind of the assassin in all its passion, vanity and delusion: “Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment”; “After being hunted like a dog through swamps, woods and last night being chased by gun boats till I was forced to return wet cold and starving, with every mans hand against me, I am here in despair”; “I am abandoned, with the curse of Cain upon me”; “I bless the entire world. Have never hated or wronged anyone. This last was not a wrong, unless God deems it so.” The notebook takes readers back to Booth’s hiding places. It is easy to hear his pencil scratching against paper as he scribbles his final thoughts. One can imagine the soldiers plundering it from his body and rifling through its pages in the firelight of the blazing tobacco barn, or War Secretary Stanton scrutinizing it for clues about the assassination after it was brought back to Washington.            The announcement of Booth's fate. (Cade Martin)    Broadside Announcing Booth’s Death  After Booth died, at sunrise on April 26, Col. Everton Conger, one of the leaders of the patrol that had tracked him down, rushed back to Washington to report to his superior, detective Lafayette Baker. Together, at about 5:30 p.m., they went to Edwin Stanton’s home to give him the news. “We have got Booth,” Baker told him. The exhausted war secretary had no energy for grand language or historical pronouncements. The statement he drafted, and which a War Department telegrapher transmitted across the nation, contained just the news that America had been waiting 12 days to hear. A broadside repeated the report:  BOOTH, THE ASSASSIN, SHOT  War Department, Washington. April 27, 9:20 A.M.  Maj. General Dix, New-York:  Booth was chased out of a swamp in St. Mary’s county, Maryland,  by Col. Barker’s [i.e., Baker] force, and took refuge in a barn on Garrett’s farm, near Port Royal. The barn was fired and Booth shot and killed. His companion, Harrold [David Herold], was captured. Harrold and Booth’s body are now here.  E.M. Stanton, Secretary of War.  When a unique example of this broadside, hitherto unknown, surfaced unheralded a decade ago at a small regional auction, I added it to my archives. It is published here for the first time.            This military drum is no different from thousands manufactured during the Civil War—except for the history written onto the drum head. A remnant of black mourning ribbon still hangs from the bottom rim. (Cade Martin)    Mourning Drum  Abraham Lincoln’s final journey began when soldiers placed his corpse aboard a special train that traveled the 1,600 miles from Washington, D.C., to Springfield, Illinois, over 13 days. One million Americans viewed his corpse in the great cities of the North, and seven million people watched his funeral train pass by. Whenever Lincoln’s body was removed from the train for a public viewing, military units joined the procession, and the troops marched to the sound of massed drums. In Springfield, the corpse was displayed for 24 hours in an open casket at the State House, where Lincoln had served as a legislator and given his famous 1858 “House Divided” speech. And at 11:30 a.m. on May 4, 1865, the drums beat one last time for Father Abraham as the funeral procession exited the State House and passed Lincoln’s old home at Eighth and Jackson streets en route to Oak Ridge Cemetery.  One of those drums—a long-lost relic bearing a patina of dust and neglect—was recently discovered in Illinois. It is no different from thousands of military company drums manufactured during the Civil War for use by teenage drummer boys in an infantry company of one hundred men. It has a body of unpainted tulipwood or ash, calfskin heads, painted oak rims, hemp cords and leather pulls to adjust the tautness of the heads and the brightness of the sound. This one was made in Granville, Massachusetts, by Noble & Cooley, a firm founded in 1854 and still in business today. Its oak rims have been beaten down from countless drumstick strikes—more than on any other Civil War drum I’ve ever seen—and no marks indicate which regiment or company the drummer played for. But a remnant of black mourning ribbon—a few inches from a coil that must have once laced the drum—still hangs from the bottom rim. And on the top head, written in ink, is a remarkable history: “This Drum was Played at Pres Lincoln’s Funeral in Springfield Ill.” On the day I acquired it, I held a pair of Civil War-era drumsticks in my hands and—careful not to damage the fragile calfskin head—tapped out faintly the muffled sound of the funeral march.  Editor's note: This story initially said that Booth fired a one-ounce lead ball at Lincoln's head. While t he plaque beneath Booth’s Deringer at the Ford’s Theatre Museum lists the weight of the bullet as “nearly an ounce,” the National Museum of Health and Medicine, where the bullet is displayed today, says it has no record of its weight and it cannot be weighed now because it has been permanently mounted. Bullets in the 1860s were not uniform. A f irearms expert at the National Museum of American History says 0.32 ounces is well within the realm of reason.     Like this article?

Lee's surrender to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, President Abraham Lincoln is assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a famous actor, while watching the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Booth and his co-conspirators hope that the assassinations of Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Vice President Andrew Johnson would leave the Union government in chaos and leave time for the Confederacy to recover. The separate attempts against Seward and Johnson fail, but Booth enters the presidential box, shoots Lincoln in the back of the head, scuffles with Lincoln's guest in the presidential box, and jumps awkwardly to the stage below, breaking his left leg in the process. Booth raises his knife in the air, cries out \"sic semper tyrannies,\" meaning \"thus always to tyrants,\" and flees. At 7:22 a.m. the next morning, Lincoln dies in a bed at the Peterson House across the street from the theater. On April 26, 1865, John Wilkes Booth is killed by a Union soldier, and on July 7, 1865, four persons convicted of conspiring with Booth are hanged, including, controversially, Mary Surratt, the owner of the boarding house where Booth stayed and plotted the assassination.

Lincoln warned the South in his Inaugural Address: “In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you…. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it.”  Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force to defend Federal law and the Union. When Confederate batteries fired on Fort Sumter and forced its surrender, he called on the states for 75,000 volunteers. Four more slave states joined the Confederacy but four remained within the Union. The Civil War had begun.  The son of a Kentucky frontiersman, Lincoln had to struggle for a living and for learning. Five months before receiving his party’s nomination for President, he sketched his life:  “I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families–second families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks…. My father … removed from Kentucky to … Indiana, in my eighth year…. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up…. Of course when I came of age I did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher … but that was all.”  Lincoln made extraordinary efforts to attain knowledge while working on a farm, splitting rails for fences, and keeping store at New Salem, Illinois. He was a captain in the Black Hawk War, spent eight years in the Illinois legislature, and rode the circuit of courts for many years. His law partner said of him, “His ambition was a little engine that knew no rest.”  He married Mary Todd, and they had four boys, only one of whom lived to maturity. In 1858 Lincoln ran against Stephen A. Douglas for Senator. He lost the election, but in debating with Douglas he gained a national reputation that won him the Republican nomination for President in 1860.  As President, he built the Republican Party into a strong national organization. Further, he rallied most of the northern Democrats to the Union cause. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation that declared forever free those slaves within the Confederacy.  Lincoln never let the world forget that the Civil War involved an even larger issue. This he stated most movingly in dedicating the military cemetery at Gettysburg: “that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain–that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom–and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”  Lincoln won re-election in 1864, as Union military triumphs heralded an end to the war. In his planning for peace, the President was flexible and generous, encouraging Southerners to lay down their arms and join speedily in reunion.  The spirit that guided him was clearly that of his Second Inaugural Address, now inscribed on one wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D. C.: “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds…. ”  On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated at Ford’s Theatre in Washington by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, who somehow thought he was helping the South. The opposite was the result, for with Lincoln’s death, the possibility of peace with magnanimity died.

He was the first president of the United States to be assassinated.  Where was Lincoln killed?  President Lincoln was attending a play called Our American Cousin at the Ford Theatre in Washington, D.C. He was sitting in the Presidential Box with his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, and their guests Major Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris.   Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre which was not too far from the White House. Photo by Ducksters   How was he killed?  When the play reached a point where there was a big joke and the audience laughed loudly, John Wilkes Booth entered President Lincoln's box and shot him in the back of the head. Major Rathbone tried to stop him, but Booth stabbed Rathbone. Then Booth jumped from the box and fled. He was able to get outside the theatre and onto his horse to escape.  President Lincoln was carried to William Petersen's boarding house across the street. There were several doctors with him, but they could not help him. He died on April 15, 1865.  Booth used this small pistol to shoot Lincoln at close range. Photo by Ducksters   Conspiracy   John Wilkes Booth by Alexander Gardner John Wilkes Booth was a Confederate sympathizer. He felt that the war was ending and that the South was going to lose unless they did something drastic. He gathered some partners together and first made a plan to kidnap President Lincoln. When his kidnapping plan failed he turned to assassination. The plan was that Booth would kill the president while Lewis Powell would assassinate the Secretary of State William H. Seward and George Atzerodt would kill Vice President Andrew Johnson .\n",
            "Although Booth was successful, fortunately Powell was unable to kill Seward and Atzerodt lost his nerve and never attempted to assassinate Andrew Johnson.  Captured  Booth was cornered in a barn south of Washington where he was shot by soldiers after he refused to surrender. The other conspirators were caught and several were hanged for their crimes.  Wanted poster for the conspirators. Photo by Ducksters   Interesting facts about Lincoln's Assassination  The Petersen House is located directly across the street from the Ford's Theater Photo by Ducksters   There was a policeman assigned to guard President Lincoln. His name was John Frederick Parker. He was not at his post when Booth entered the box and was likely at a nearby tavern at the time.  Booth broke his leg when he jumped out of the box and onto the stage.  When Booth stood on the stage he yelled out the Virginia State Motto \"Sic semper tyrannis\" which means \"Thus always to tyrants\".  The Ford Theatre shut down after the assassination. The government purchased it and turned it into a warehouse. It was unused for many years until 1968 when it was reopened as a Museum and theatre. The Presidential Box is never used.

The anatomy of the President's fatal wound, and what modern medicine could have done for him  Philip Mackowiak   November 29, 2013          Link Copied      Lincoln's last formal photograph, taken February 5, 1865 by Alexander Gardner. ( Wikipedia ) Abraham Lincoln often spoke and dreamed about being assassinated, convinced that he would not outlast the rebellion when his work would have been done. Prior to his inauguration, he received letters warning him that he would be killed before reaching Washington. After he died an envelope with eighty such letters was found among his eﬀects, and although twice while president he had his hat shot from his head by unknown assailants, he deprecated all attempts to guard his life. An assassin’s bullet ﬁnally found him on April 15, 1865, during a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, DC. He was seated in a private box when shot with a .44-caliber bullet ﬁred from a Derringer at close range. The bullet entered the back of his skull to the left of the midline and just above the left lateral sinus (a large venous channel that drains blood from the left side of the brain), which it severed. It penetrated the dura mater (the outermost membrane covering the brain), passed through the left posterior lobe of the brain into the left lateral ventricle, and came to rest in the white matter, just above the anterior portion of the left corpus striatum. It fractured both orbital plates of the frontal bone, causing the eye sockets to become engorged with blood and pushing fragments of bone into the brain.        Dr. Charles A. Leale, a 23-year-old assistant surgeon, U.S. Volunteers, reached the patient within minutes of the shooting and was accosted immediately by a distraught First Lady crying: “Oh, physician! Is he dead? Can he recover?” The President was not yet dead. However, after a cursory examination, Leale announced: “His wound is mortal; it is impossible for him to recover.” At 7:20 a.m., Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States of America, breathed his last, and his spirit ﬂed to God who gave it. Why Lincoln died is no mystery. His wound, as Dr. Leale predicted, was mortal, because in 1865 little could be done for patients with such wounds. Today modern advances in trauma care have greatly expanded our capacity to manage traumatic brain injuries and have radically altered the prognosis of patients with injuries like Lincoln’s. Could these techniques have saved Lincoln if they had been available in 1865, and if so, what would he have been capable of in the aftermath of such care? These questions were addressed in 2007 by Dr. Thomas M. Scalea, director of the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, the world’s oldest such center, at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, during the school’s bicentennial celebration. Dr. Scalea believes that recent advancements in trauma care discussed below would not only have saved Lincoln’s life, but would also have restored much of the President’s neurological function. Lincoln was shot in the left occiput at close range with a relatively low-velocity bullet. Two young physicians, Dr. Charles Leale, who had graduated from medical school only days before the shooting, and Dr. Charles Taft, just 30 years old, cared for Lincoln. In accordance with the medical practice of the day, they repeatedly probed the President’s wound to prevent blood from accumulating within the skull and compressing his brain. For a time, this maneuver relieved Lincoln’s respiratory distress. Lincoln’s initial symptoms and his dilated left pupil were caused by cerebral herniation—displacement and compression of vital areas of the brain by blood and edema ﬂuid accumulating within his skull. His physicians remarked that “as long as bleeding continued, the President’s condition remained stable. When the ﬂow stopped, the vital signs weakened … It would produce signs of increased compression. The breathing became stertorous and intermittent, and the pulse became more feeble and irregular.” The most likely path of the bullet that killed Lincoln was through the left lateral sinus. As it traveled through the brain, it created pressure waves that damaged the brain stem (the upper spinal cord). It also produced intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the inner cavities of the brain), a deep laceration of the left cerebral hemisphere, and bilateral subdural hematomas (pools of blood collected on the surface of the brain). In time, these primary injuries (i.e., those occurring at the time of impact) were likely magniﬁed by inadequate delivery of oxygen to the brain resulting from repeated episodes of hypotension and the president’s irregular breathing. This, in turn, caused pressure within the skull (the intracranial pressure [ICP]) to rise, producing additional (secondary) damage to the brain. The arteries of the base of the brain ( Wikipedia ) Lincoln’s intracerebral hemorrhaging would have caused his ICP to soar. Whereas repeated probing of his wound allowed blood to escape from his skull and for a time relieved his elevated ICP, it also contributed to substantial blood loss. The brain is an extremely vascular organ and when injured bleeds profusely. In fact, Lincoln’s attendants commented that his sheets were crimson and his bed surrounded by a pool of blood. Thus, it is likely that he died because of both cerebral herniation and massive hemorrhaging.        Modern trauma care involves a continuum of activities that can be artiﬁcially divided into several phases. The process begins with a preliminary assessment of the patient at the scene of the injury and application of stabilization measures, such as assisted respiration and the administration of intravenous ﬂuids. Appropriate patients are then quickly transported to trauma centers for special- ized care. At the trauma center, another examination is performed to identify immediately life-threatening injuries, which are dealt with as discovered. Next, resuscitation measures as, for example, blood transfusions in the case of Lincoln, are administered as needed, followed by a more systematic, head-to-toe physical examination and appropriate radiographic studies, after which deﬁnitive care is given. Today, a trauma system of this sort would be activated promptly if the President were injured. In fact, whenever the President leaves the White House, area trauma centers are alerted so that they are available immediately in case of illness or injury involving the chief executive. When the President travels in Maryland, the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland is the one alerted and remains on standby, ready to provide care as needed. Although the advantages of stabilizing trauma patients in the ﬁeld, so-called “stay-and-play”, versus immediate transport to a trauma center, so-called “scoop-and-run”, might be debated in injuries as severe as Lincoln’s, there is no question that in an urban environment such as the Baltimore/Washington, DC area, with its trauma center literally just minutes away, the “scoop-and-run” option is the best. One might argue, for example, that patients with brain injuries of the magnitude of Lincoln’s should be intubated in the ﬁeld. However, in a recent survey of patients with severe brain injuries treated in the Maryland Trauma System, an organization with considerable airway-management experience, patients intubated upon arrival at the trauma center had a substantially better outcome than those intubated in the ﬁeld. Therefore, Lincoln would have been managed best initially by inserting an intravenous line, through which ﬂuids and blood might be administered, and by assisting his breathing, using a ventilation bag attached to a ventilation mask. Once he arrived at the Trauma Center, an endotracheal tube would have been inserted promptly into his upper airway by a trained anesthesiologist. Inserting an endotracheal tube ( Wikimedia Commons ) Although hyperventilation (rapid forced ventilation) has traditionally been used to reduce brain swelling in patients with severe head injuries, it has not been shown to improve outcome. Hyperventilation does reduce ICP but, unfortunately, does so by diminishing the ﬂow of blood to the brain, which, in turn, reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain. Nevertheless, in patients like Lincoln with impending herniation, hyperventilation is sometimes the only way of lowering ICP rapidly enough to prevent herniation.        President Lincoln’s dilated left pupil reﬂected impending herniation and would have been treated initially with an intravenous concentrated salt solution to support his blood pressure and also to lower his ICP by drawing edema ﬂuid from his damaged brain back into the bloodstream. Because Lincoln’s ICP was almost certainly extremely high, he also would have been treated with modest hyperventilation. A chest x-ray would have been performed, along with an array of routine blood tests. After a third physical examination searching for previously unrecognized injuries, he would have been rushed to the computed tomography (CT) scanner for a deﬁnitive examination of his head injury. In that acute subdural hematomas must be evacuated promptly in patients with signs of impending herniation, Lincoln would next have been wheeled into the operating room for an emergency craniotomy, ideally within 15 minutes of his arrival in the Trauma Center. His surgery would have been performed by neurosurgeons continuously on call in a room permanently on standby for such emergencies. The neurosurgeons would evacuate the President’s hematomas, débride the bullet’s entrance wound, and repair the damaged dura. They would also place catheters inside his skull to monitor his ICP, cerebral blood ﬂow, and brain oxygen levels, as well as to remove cerebrospinal ﬂuid as needed to lower the ICP. Another head CT scan would be performed looking for evidence of further secondary damage requiring additional surgery. When all necessary surgery had been performed, the president would have been moved to an intensive care unit. Traumatic brain injury, even if unaccompanied by other injuries, is a systemic disorder in that it activates a neurohumoral cascade—a sequence of pathophysiological reactions involving hormones as well as nerves—capable of causing dysfunction of virtually every organ system. The circulatory system and the lungs are especially hard hit. In certain cases, a full-blown systemic inﬂammatory response ensues, resulting in intestinal dysfunction, renal failure, and a generalized capillary leak. Sometimes, patients develop a coagulopathy (inappropriate clotting of the blood), both as a consequence of clotting mediators released by injured brain tissues and as a complication of transfusions given to replace blood lost as a result of both the injury and surgery. While in the intensive care unit, Lincoln’s ICP, blood pressure, and blood oxy- gen level each would be monitored closely, with measures taken to optimize the ﬂow of blood and oxygen to his damaged brain. Antibiotics would be given to prevent infection, along with anticonvulsants to prevent seizures. Because traumatic brain injuries are associated with substantial tissue breakdown, not just at the site of the injury but throughout the body, early intravenous nutritional sup- port would be added to his treatments to facilitate healing. Sequential compression devices would be applied to his legs as soon as he was stabilized, along with low-molecular-weight heparin on the third postoperative day to prevent blood clots from forming in the deep veins of his legs.        Some trauma patients develop dangerously high ICPs that are refractory to the measures listed above and require additional, more aggressive interventions to bring their ICP under control. One such intervention is decompressive craniectomy, in which a portion of the skull is removed and saved for possible replacement at a later date to permit the brain to swell unimpeded in the immediate aftermath of the injury. Because the skull is a rigid container, swelling of the brain or bleeding into it causes the ICP to increase. If it rises to a level greater than the pressure within the brain’s blood vessels, blood ﬂow to the brain ceases. In such cases, decompressive craniectomy may be the only eﬀective means of lowering the ICP and restoring proper delivery of glucose and oxygen to the brain. In the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, decompressive craniectomy has been used successfully to relieve refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension 80 percent of the time, and achieved a survival rate of 78 percent with a favorable neurological outcome in 50 percent of such patients. The ICP correlates closely with the pressure inside both the thorax and the abdomen in patients with severe head trauma , in all likelihood because of communication between the three anatomical compartments via their venous systems. On occasion, harnessing this relationship is the only means, albeit a drastic one, of alleviating refractory intracranial hypertension in patients with severe head trauma. In a recent series of 17 such patients, abdominal decompression (opening the abdomen surgically to reduce intra-abdominal pressure) lowered ICP by nearly 50 percent, even in the absence of elevated intra-abdominal pressure preoperatively. Optimal management combining early mobilization, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, and early aggressive rehabilitation might have saved Lincoln. However, it could not have restored his neurological function to normal. At best, he would have been left with several permanent neurological deﬁcits. Patients surviving injuries like his tend to have increased impulsivity, lack of emotional control, decreased problem-solving ability, and impaired eye–hand coordination. Given the nature and extent of Lincoln’s injury, almost certainly he also would have been left with right hemiplegia (paralysis of his right side) and homonymous hemianopsia (blindness in the right half of the visual ﬁeld of both eyes), as well as dyslexia, dysgraphia (diﬃculty writing), and dysphasia (diﬃculty speaking). However, because his frontal lobe was largely spared, his cognition likely would have remained reasonably intact. His rehabilitation would have been long and difﬁcult and at a minimum would have involved a team of professionals consisting of a physiatrist, a neuropsychologist, a speech therapist, a physical therapist, and an occupational therapist. The full extent of his recovery would have taken several years of intensive rehabilitation to have been realized.        When Lincoln died, he was succeeded as president by Andrew Johnson, a Southern Democrat lacking in diplomatic skills and incapable of compromise. Johnson vetoed unsuccessfully many of the civil rights bills Lincoln would have endorsed. He also ignored passage of “black codes” by Southern states, whereby blacks were prevented from leaving current positions or owning land. He tried to force provisional governors to turn over state control to former Confederate leaders and vetoed legislation creating both the Freedmen’s Bureau, which was trying to help newly liberated blacks assimilate into a free society, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. He also vetoed three Reconstruction acts designed to give blacks the right to vote, before Congress ﬁnally passed the 14th Amendment in 1868. If Lincoln had lived but been disabled, the situation might well have been even more chaotic, because in 1865 no provision existed for the Vice President or anyone else to take over as chief executive for an incapacitated president. At that time, the Constitution contained provisions for the transfer of such power only when a president died. Not until 1967 was the 25th Amendment passed, which speciﬁes the procedures by which the government deals with an incapacitated president. Given the extent of the damage to Lincoln’s brain caused by the bullet from Booth’s Derringer, one would be inclined to dismiss Dr. Scalea’s prediction regarding what his team might have accomplished as overly optimistic. However, the case of U.S. Representative Gabrielle (Gabby) Giffords seems to suggest otherwise. On January 27, 2011, she was shot in the head with a Glock semiautomatic pistol. A 9mm bullet entered the back of her head just to the left of the midline at almost exactly the same spot at which Booth’s bullet entered Lincoln’s head, and traveled the same path as Booth’s bullet before exiting through the front of her skull near her left eye socket. Giffords was treated according to a protocol similar to that outlined above, including removal of a portion of her skull to allow her brain to swell unimpeded, after which she participated in an intensive rehabilitation program. Now, a little over a year later, she can walk, she can speak in a halting manner, and she is apparently hopeful of one day returning to politics. Although Giffords’ case seems to validate Dr. Scalea’s conclusions, no two head trauma cases are identical. Whereas Lincoln’s and Giffords’ injuries have much in common, they also diﬀer in several important aspects. Lincoln was shot with a .44-caliber low-velocity bullet, Giffords with a 9mm high-velocity bullet. Lincoln’s bullet didn’t exit the skull; Giffords’ did. Most important, Giffords’ bullet traveled only through the left side of her brain. Lincoln’s is thought to have done so as well; however, Leale’s description of a bulging right eye suggests that the bullet actually crossed the midline into the right cerebral hemisphere, in which case Lincoln’s chances of surviving his injury, even if treated in a modern shock trauma center, much less recovering neurological function to Giffords’ degree, would be minimal.        On January 4, 2006, Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel, suﬀered a different though no less devastating brain injury—a massive stroke. The Israeli heath care system, arguably one of the best in the world, reacted quickly and decisively with a series of sophisticated interventions, hoping for the kind of miraculous recovery sometimes seen in such patients. In spite of a host of aggressive measures, including several surgeries related to his comatose state, Sharon never regained his cognitive abilities. He was placed in a long-term care facility on November 6, 2007. Six years later, he is alive but in a persistent vegetative state. Abraham Lincoln suﬀered his massive brain injury almost a century and a half earlier. The health care system in which his physicians operated was far less sophisticated than that of modern-day Israel or the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. It had neither the knowledge nor the tools to save Lincoln’s life, much less preserve his cognitive abilities, in the aftermath of Booth’s attack. If Dr. Scalea’s team had had access to Lincoln at the time of the assassination, perhaps he might have survived, albeit with right-sided hemiplegia and homonymous hemianopsia, along with persistent dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dysphasia. If so, he might yet have retained enough cognitive and communicative function to have restrained the forces of prejudice and vindictiveness that marred Johnson’s period of reconstruction. Lincoln’s genius, after all, was that “In the cave of winds in which he saw history in the making, he was more a listener than a talker.” However, in medicine as in politics, nothing is certain. Although under the care of a trauma team like Dr. Scalea’s Lincoln might have made a recovery as miraculous as that of Giffords, he might also have fared no better, or even worse, than under the care of Doctors Leale and Taft. As in the case of Ariel Sharon, modern technology produces tragic failures along with spectacular successes. Sometimes a life is saved only to leave the patient “to linger in dying … never again [to] speak, see, hear, or awaken into a conscious being.” It is because of such uncertainty that knowing when not to treat can be more diﬃcult and more important than knowing how to treat.

Bruce Handy reviews Our American Cousin , the comic play that Lincoln saw the night he was killed. By Bruce Hand y  April 14, 2015 From Buyenlarge/Getty Images. Our American Cousin , a once-popular comedy, is the play Abraham Lincoln was watching when he was assassinated at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., on the night of April 14, 1865—150 years ago today. In an effort to answer one of that tragedy’s most enduring mysteries— “Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, what did you think of the play?” —I recently read the text of Our American Cousin , a version of which is [available on Project Gutenberg.] (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3158/3158-h/3158-h.htm) While I can’t speak for Mrs. Lincoln, I can say that I was pleasantly surprised: if not exactly funny, if not even somewhere in the vicinity of “good,” the play is better than its awful reputation as a mere repository of dated, cornpone gags, though it is that, too. But I think it is fair to say that if you are going to die a violent unexpected death, having a performance of Our American Cousin be the very last thing you see would be far preferable to having the last thing you see be Dallas, even on a nice day. It is true that 90 percent of the play’s jokes turn on dumb puns arising from characters mishearing one another, often due to thick accents or “humorous” speech impediments. But once you get past that, the play has a charmingly deliberate goofiness, a sense of humor about its own dumbness that is not so far removed from the tone of a lot of contemporary film comedy. Were the play’s text finagled with quite a bit here and a little bit there (19th-century slurs against blacks and Jews out ; 21st-century penis jokes in ) Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis, or Seth Rogan could play the title character: a backwoodsman from Vermont, a distant relation to a noble English family, who is visiting the family’s manor house to receive an unexpected inheritance. It’s the classic fish-out-of-water premise that Hollywood still loves: Kevin Hart inherits Downton Abbey! Jonah Hill has to figure out which one is the oyster fork! The original playbill for Our American Cousin on the night of Lincoln’s assassination.  The play was written by Tom Taylor, an Englishman, and premiered in New York City in 1858—an instant smash. “The houses are crowded to over-flowing,” the New York Times [reported several weeks] (http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/11/08/issue.html) after the opening. The popular female lead, Laura Keene, would go on to produce and star in the production Lincoln saw seven years later. The play spawned numerous sequels— Our Female American Cousin opened in New York a mere three months after the original—and, despite any post-assassination notoriety, it remained popular and was often revived through to the end of the 19th century. There was no “ Our American Cousin Curse,” other than the incident you already know about. As you’d expect, much of the play’s humor involves the hero, Asa Trenchard, misapprehending British customs while his blueblood relations, who think there are buffalo and Crow Indians roaming all over Vermont, find his rustic speech and behavior either appalling or charming, depending on how snooty or not they are. Of course Asa turns out to be wiser than any of the toffs. There are a couple of lines in the play that actually made me laugh, although if I were to quote them I’d have to supply so much explanatory context the jokes would wilt (and believe me, they are not so sturdy to begin with). Here is a first act passage that will give you a good overall sense of the play’s wit.\n",
            "The scene: a conversation between the clever but good-hearted English heroine, Florence, and Lord Dundreary, a stereotypical upper-class twit who lisps and also does that Elmer Fudd thing where “r”s are pronounced as “w”s. They are discussing another young lady, Georgina, a husband-hunter who has designs on Dundreary. Her method of flirtation: pretending to suffer from one of those swooning, attractive-to-19th-century-eyes maladies of the nerves. Georgina is off-stage in this scene, but her calculating mother, the wonderfully-named Mrs. Mountchessington, is present . . . Advertisement Mrs. Mountchessington: She is a great sufferer, my dear. Dundreary: Yeth, but a lonely one. Florence: What sort of night had she? Mrs. Mountchessington: Oh, a very refreshing one, thanks to the\n",
            "draught you were kind enough to prescribe for her, Lord Dundreary. Florence: What! Has Lord Dundreary been prescribing for Georgina? Dundreary: Yeth. You see I gave her a draught that cured the effect of\n",
            "the draught, and that draught was a draft that didn’t pay the doctor’s\n",
            "bill. Didn’t that draught— Florence: Good gracious! What a number of draughts. You almost have a\n",
            "game of draughts. Dundreary: Ha! Ha! Ha! Florence: What’s the matter? Dundreary: That wath a joke, that wath. Florence: Where’s the joke? . . . Dundreary: Don’t you see—a game of drafts—pieces of wound wood on\n",

            "brains to the test. I want to ask you a whime. Florence: A whime, what’s that? Dundreary: A whime is a widdle, you know. Florence: A widdle! Dundreary: Yeth; one of those things, like—why is so and so or\n",
            "somebody like somebody else. Florence: Oh, I see, you mean a conundrum. Drundreary: Yeth, a drum, that’s the idea And so on. A couple of thoughts: one, we shouldn’t be too condescending toward what our ancestors found entertaining, lest posterity do the same to us. (Case in point: I am writing this on a transcontinental plane flight and the man sitting next to me appears intent on spending the entire six hours watching a Keeping Up with the Kardashians marathon on E!) And two, while we might prefer our greatest president to have been shot attending Macbeth or Hamlet or even Titus Andronicus , the Civil War had just ended five days earlier and he was surely in need of some cheap, easy laughs. He might have also identified with a play about a rustic who shows up all the people who condescended to him. Edward Askew Sothern as Lord Dundreary in Our American Cousin .  From Hulton Archive/Getty Images. The play’s most famous line also relates to Mrs. Mountchessington. She has set another of her single daughters after Asa, not realizing he has selflessly given up the inheritance that set the play in motion. Asa, fully aware of what she’s up to, has some fun pretending to encourage the daughter. When Mrs. Mountchessington learns the truth, she confronts the American with all the hauteur she can muster: “I am aware, Mr. Trenchard, you are not used to the manners of good society, and that, alone, will excuse the impertinence of which you have been guilty.” To which he responds as she exits: Advertisement “Don’t know the manners of good society, eh? Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal—you sockdologizing old man-trap.” This line was a proven laugh-getter— sockdologizing is a piece of old American slang that in this context means scheming—and John Wilkes Booth, an actor who knew the play, chose that precise moment to shoot the president in the back of the head, in hopes that the crowd’s laughter would cover the noise of his pistol shot, though he sacrificed whatever stealth that provided by shouting “Sic semper tyrannis” and jumping on the stage. This came halfway through the third act, so the audience never got to see how things turned out for Asa and Florence and Lord Dundreary. (Happily.) History does not record whether refunds were offered. Amazingly, we do know what Mrs. Lincoln thought of the play, aside from “that,” if we can trust a biased source. Twelve days after the assassination, the Times published a letter written by Harry Hawk, who [played Asa in the Ford’s Theater production.] (http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1865/04/26/88155031.html?pageNumber=2) He was the only actor on stage at the time of the shooting. He describes Booth leaping to the stage and shouting, “The South shall be free!” Booth had a knife, and Hawk, thinking he too was about to be attacked, fled the stage. The letter concludes, with a performer’s myopia I found charming: On that night the play was going so well. Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln enjoyed\n",

His family moved to Indiana when he was seven and he grew up on the edge of the frontier. He had very little formal education, but read voraciously when not working on his father’s farm.  A childhood friend later recalled Lincoln's \"manic\" intellect, and the sight of him red-eyed and tousle-haired as he pored over books late into the night.  In 1828, at the age of nineteen, he accompanied a produce-laden flatboat down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana—his first visit to a large city--and then walked back home.  Two years later, trying to avoid health and finance troubles, Lincoln's father moved the family moved to Illinois.    After moving away from home, Lincoln co-owned a general store for several years before selling his stake and enlisting as a militia captain defending Illinois in the Black Hawk War of 1832.  Black Hawk, a Sauk chief, believed he had been swindled by a recent land deal and sought to resettle his old holdings.  Lincoln did not see direct combat during the short conflict, but the sight of corpse-strewn battlefields at Stillman's Run and Kellogg's Grove deeply affected him. As a captain, he developed a reputation for pragmatism and integrity.  Once, faced with a rail fence during practice maneuvers and forgetting the parade-ground instructions to direct his men over it, he simply ordered them to fall out and reassemble on the other side a minute later.  Another time, he stopped his men before they executed a wandering Native American as a spy.  Stepping in front of their raised muskets, Lincoln is said to have challenged his men to combat for the terrified native's life.  His men stood down.  After the war, he studied law and campaigned for a seat on the Illinois State Legislature. Although not elected in his first attempt, Lincoln persevered and won the position in 1834, serving as a Whig.  Abraham Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois where he was practicing as a lawyer. They were married in 1842 over her family’s objections and had four sons.  Only one lived to adulthood.  The deep melancholy that pervaded the Lincoln family, with occasional detours into outright madness, is in some ways sourced in their close relationship with death.  Lincoln, a self-described \"prairie lawyer,\" focused on his all-embracing law practice in the early 1850s after one term in Congress from 1847 to 1849. He joined the new Republican party—and the ongoing argument over sectionalism—in 1856. A series of heated debates in 1858 with Stephen A. Douglas , the sponsor of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act , over slavery and its place in the United States forged Lincoln into a prominent figure in national politics. Lincoln’s anti-slavery platform made him extremely unpopular with Southerners and his nomination for President in 1860 enraged them.  On November 6, 1860, Lincoln won the presidential election without the support of a single Southern state.  Talk of secession, bandied about since the 1830s, took on a serious new tone. The Civil War was not entirely caused by Lincoln’s election, but the election was one of the primary reasons the war broke out the following year.  Lincoln’s decision to fight rather than to let the Southern states secede was not based on his feelings towards slavery.  Rather, he felt it was his sacred duty as President of the United States to preserve the Union at all costs.  His first inaugural address was an appeal to the rebellious states, seven of which had already seceded, to rejoin the nation.  His first draft of the speech ended with an ominous message: \"Shall it be peace, or the sword?\"  The Civil War with the opening bombardment of Fort Sumter , South Carolina, on April 12, 1861.  Lincoln forced the Confederate hand with his decision to resupply the fort, which had suddenly become an outpost in a hostile nation.  The Southern navy turned away the supply convoy and then fired the first shot of the war at Fort Sumter, forcing the Federal defenders to surrender after a 34-hour battle.  Throughout the war Lincoln struggled to find capable generals for his armies.  As commander-in-chief, he legally held the highest rank in the United States armed forces, and he diligently exercised his authority through strategic planning, weapons testing, and the promotion and demotion of officers. McDowell , Fremont, McClellan , Pope , McClellan again, Buell , Burnside , Rosecrans --all of these men and more withered under Lincoln's watchful eye as they failed to bring him success on the battlefield.  He did not issue his famous Emancipation Proclamation until January 1, 1863 after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam .  The Emancipation Proclamation, which was legally based on the President’s right to seize the property of those in rebellion against the State, only freed slaves in Southern states where Lincoln’s forces had no control. Nevertheless, it changed the tenor of the war, making it, from the Northern point of view, a fight both to preserve the Union and to end slavery.    In 1864, Lincoln ran again for President.  After years of war, he feared he would not win.  Only in the final months of the campaign did the exertions of Ulysses S. Grant , the quiet general now in command of all of the Union armies, begin to bear fruit.  A string of heartening victories buoyed Lincoln's ticket and contributed significantly to his re-election.  In his second inauguration speech , March 4, 1865, he set the tone he intended to take when the war finally ended. His one goal, he said, was “lasting peace among ourselves.” He called for “malice towards none” and “charity for all.” The war ended only a month later.  The Lincoln administration did more than just manage the Civil War, although its reverberations could still be felt in a number of policies.  The Revenue Act of 1862 established the United States' first income tax, largely to pay the costs of total war.  The Morrill Act of 1862 established the basis of the state university system in this country, while the Homestead Act, also passed in 1862, encouraged settlement of the West by offering 160 acres of free land to settlers.  Lincoln also created the Department of Agriculture and formally instituted the Thanksgiving holiday.  Internationally, he navigated the \"Trent Affair,\" a diplomatic crisis regarding the seizure of a British ship carrying Confederate envoys, in such a way as to quell the saber-rattling overtures coming from Britain as well as the United States.  In another spill-over from the war, Lincoln restricted the civil liberties of due process and freedom of the press.  On April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., Abraham Lincoln was shot by Confederate sympathizer, John Wilkes Booth.  The assassination was part of a larger plot to eliminate the Northern government that also left Secretary of State William Seward grievously injured.  Lincoln died the following day, and with him the hope of reconstructing the nation without bitterness.

The president was at Ford’s Theater attending a play called Our American Cousin, and he was assassinated by an actor named John Wilkes Booth. But John Wilkes Booth was no ordinary actor at Ford’s Theater. Booth was a highly respected actor who used his charisma, charm, and good looks to forge a very successful career on stages around the country. The assassination of the president was only one part of a conspiracy that Booth concocted to overthrow the entire United States government. Booth had targeted the vice president and several other members of the federal government for assassination by his cohorts on the same night he was to kill the president, but Booth would be the only person who would succeed in eliminating his target.

But John Wilkes Booth was no ordinary actor at Ford’s Theater. Booth was a highly respected actor who used his charisma, charm, and good looks to forge a very successful career on stages around the country. The assassination of the president was only one part of a conspiracy that Booth concocted to overthrow the entire United States government. Booth had targeted the vice president and several other members of the federal government for assassination by his cohorts on the same night he was to kill the president, but Booth would be the only person who would succeed in eliminating his target.       Prior to the assassination, on March 17, 1865, Booth and his group attempted to kidnap President Lincoln as the president left Campbell Military Hospital after attending a play called Still Waters Run Deep. But the plan was thwarted when the president decided to attend a different military ceremony instead of attending the play. It was at that point that Booth indicated that he had plans to kill the president as the president gave his inaugural address, but he could not get close enough to the president to pull off his plan. Booth vowed to get the job done, and he chose April 14 as his date.  Approximately 10 days before the assassination, President Lincoln revealed to his wife, Mary Todd, that he had a dream about people weeping in the White House over the death of an important figure. When the president asked a soldier in his dream who everyone was crying about, the soldier said, “the president.” The timing of that dream was never lost on Mary Todd Lincoln, and she often referred to it when discussing the assassination in subsequent interviews.       The president had a very pleasant day leading up to the assassination, but he had been disappointed when his son decided to stay home for the night and sleep. Lincoln’s son had fought in the Civil War and had just arrived home to the White House a few days earlier. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his wife were supposed to accompany the president to the theater that night, but they had to cancel for personal reasons. In the general’s place was sent Maj. Henry Rathbone and his wife. While the major was not necessarily sent as a security guard, his military experience was thought to offer the president an additional layer of security.  At approximately 10:25 p.m., Booth used his status as a familiar actor to the theater’s staff to gain access to the outer lobby of the president’s box. Booth was surprised to see that there were no security guards anywhere in the lobby, so he slowly opened the door to the president’s box and prepared his Philadelphia Derringer pistol to be fired. Booth waited for a line in the play that elicited a particularly loud round of laughter from the audience, and that is when he lurched forward and shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head.  After firing the fatal shot, Booth leaped from the box to the stage shouting the Virginia state motto, “Sic semper tyrannis!”, which is Latin for “Thus always the tyrants!” As Booth leaped to the stage, he caught the spur of his boot on the American flag that draped over the president’s box and fell to the stage in an awkward manner. He broke his leg and limped off the stage as quickly as he could.  The entire theater, audience and theater staff included, thought that what had happened was part of the show. But when Mary Todd Lincoln shouted out, “He’s shot the president!” and Rathbone shouted, “Stop that man!”, the audience and actors slowly realized that what had happened was real. By the time everyone was able to grasp the situation, Booth had escaped the theater and was headed for what he thought was safety in the former Confederate States of America.

Some Thought It Was Fate                     Thomas Nast's 'Palm Sunday' from Harper’s Weekly Magazine, May 20, 1865  Courtesy of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston: gift of Dr. Mavis P. and Mary Wilson, Kelsey         By Olivia B. Waxman       April 14, 2017       The calendar dates for Easter and its accompanying holy week changes every year but, by coincidence, those dates in 2017 may be familiar ones to history buffs: this year’s calendar dates for events like Palm Sunday and Good Friday are the same as they were in 1865, a year on which the significance of those dates was political, not just religious.  As the Civil War drew to its end, Confederate General Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865 — Palm Sunday — near Appomattox Court House. Then, four days later, on April 14 — Good Friday — President Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theatre. He would die the next day.  Thomas Nast, the most famous political cartoonist of the period, commemorated the coincidence with an illustration pairing an image of Christ entering Jerusalem, the event that is commemorated every Palm Sunday, with an image of Lee surrendering to Grant at Appomattox. The illustration appeared in Harper’s Weekly .

The most famous expression of this sentiment is poet Julia Ward Howe’s “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” which frames the war as potentially having an impact on the second coming, with the lines “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord” and “as He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.”  Abraham Lincoln himself also framed the war as divinely influenced, for example when he painted the conflict as God’s way of punishing the North and South for the institution of slavery in his second inaugural address : “Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.'”    And so, when Lincoln died from a bullet shot on Good Friday, the day that commemorates the crucifixion, it was no surprise that many evangelical Christians of the day drew the connection between the Biblical event and the contemporary assassination.  As Isserman puts it, “To have Lincoln, at the moment of triumph, be assassinated, be martyred for the cause of the union—many people at the time thought this was all a sign of the divine ordering of the events of the Civil War period.”  Write to Olivia B.

Jefferson Davis is elected president. Davis, a native Mississippian, had served in the Senate as a leading Southern advocate and was Secretary of War for President Franklin Pierce. Over the course of the Civil War, Davis will face the conflict between the confederate ideology of states' rights and the need for a strong, central government to lead the war against President Abraham Lincoln and the Union.  03/04/1861: Abraham Lincoln inaugurated Abraham Lincoln is inaugurated as the sixteenth President of the United States, and the nation's first Republican President. Many Southerners view his victory, determined by the free states, as the final blow in decades of sectional conflict. Between the time of Lincoln's election and his inauguration, seven states from the lower South secede. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln attempts to pacify the South by stating that he will not interfere with slavery where it exists but that the secession of states from the Union is illegal. He warns that he will respond to violence with force.  03/11/1861: Confederate Congress adopts Confederate Constitution The Confederate Congress unanimously adopts the Confederate Constitution, which declares the sovereignty of states and forbids the passage of any bill which outlaws slavery.  04/12/1861: Fort Sumter Responding to Lincoln's attempt to resupply Fort Sumter (one of the last remaining federal stations in the South), South Carolina's Confederate batteries, under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard open fire on the federal arsenal, in the Charleston harbor, at 4:30 a.m. Confederate President Jefferson Davis issues the order to Beauregard.  Civil War Begins  The American Civil War began at 4:30am on April 12, 1861, when General Pierre G. T. Beauregard's Confederate artillery opened fire on Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Beauregard's bombardment lasted for thirty-three hours until Union Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort. The Confederates took down the stars and stripes and raised the stars and bars at Fort Sumter.  Fort Sumter represented a symbol of state sovereignty to both the United States and Confederate States of America (CSA). The Confederate Provisional Congress considered it an outpost under foreign control in an important harbor. Negotiations between the CSA and the United States over Fort Sumter failed, however. On April 9, Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered Beauregard to attack Fort Sumter if Anderson refused a final appeal to surrender. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter placed responsibility for starting the Civil War on the shoulders of the Confederacy.  The fall of Fort Sumter brought the secession crisis to the breaking point. On April 15, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to serve in the U.S. Army for a period of ninety days. In doing so, Lincoln answered the South's challenge to civil war. Following Sumter, Lincoln believed that the insurrection was “too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary process of judicial proceedings.” It would be settled by force of arms. In the weeks that followed, four more states-Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, the South's most populous state-seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy.  Abraham Lincoln's decisive action following the fall of Fort Sumter inaugurated a wartime presidency in which the executive superseded the other two branches of the federal government. As commander in chief, Lincoln was responsible for how the war was conducted, and he transformed the President's role as commander in chief and as chief executive into a powerful new position. In several emergencies, Lincoln exercised powers not constitutionally granted to a President and ignored Supreme Court decisions ruling his conduct unconstitutional. Still he was committed to preserving the Union and thus vindicating democracy no matter what the consequences to himself, and his strong presidency helped save the Union.  04/13/1861: Major Anderson surrendors Out of supplies and after thirty-three hours under attack, Major Robert Anderson of Fort Sumter surrenders. The federal outpost is evacuated the next day.  04/15/1861: Lincoln calls for end of rebellion Following the incident at Fort Sumter, Lincoln calls for 75,000 militiamen (volunteer troops) to put down the rebellion. He declares that an “insurrection” exists, marking the official beginning of the Civil War. In four and a half years, nearly 5 million American men will serve as soldiers with more than 600,000 of them falling as casualties, making the Civil War the bloodiest war in American history.  04/17/1861: Virginia secedes In response to Lincoln's decision to use force in South Carolina, Virginia secedes from the nation, followed by three other upper Southern states: North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Four border slave states remain in the Union.  04/19/1861: Lincoln orders blockage With only 42 ships and 3550 miles of Confederate coastline to patrol, Lincoln orders a blockade of Confederate ports that will eventually weaken the Confederacy by disrupting the importation of supplies. Meanwhile, the first casualties of the Civil War occur in Baltimore, Maryland.  05/06/1861: Arkansas secedes Arkansas secedes from the Union.  05/10/1861: Morrill Tariff Searching for a way to finance the war, the House of Representatives passes the Morrill Tariff and excise taxes (sponsored by Senator Morrill of Vermont). The law signals a new impulse toward protectionism and the increasing centralization of the federal government. Congress becomes the regulator of imports, doubling duties and levying taxes on goods associated with manufacturers and most other professions.  05/20/1861: North Carolina secedes North Carolina secedes from the Union.  05/21/1861: Confederate capital moves to Richmond Following Virginia's secession, the capital of the confederacy moves from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia. Virginia is most populous of the Southern states.  06/08/1861: Tennessee secedes Tennessee secedes from the Union.  07/21/1861: Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Bull Run takes place near Manassas, Virginia. Confederate General Beauregard defeats the Union forces under General Irvin McDowell. Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson is nicknamed “Stonewall” for his firm stand at a crucial moment in the battle. The fighting inspires the Confederacy to create a new battle flag after confusion occurs between the Confederacy's “stars and bars” and the Union flag.  07/25/1861: The Union endorses volunteers The Union endorses the use of volunteers for the war and offers a $100 bonus for at least two years of service.  09/14/1861: Naval engagement at Pensacola The Civil War's first naval engagement occurs at Pensacola, Florida, between the USS Colorado and the steamer Judah . Navy Lt. John H. Russell and his crew arrive at the Navy yard at 2 a.m. and set fire to the Judah . The Union suffers three deaths and four wounded, while the Confederates suffer no casualties.  10/31/1861: General Winfield Scott retires General Winfield Scott retires as commander in chief of the Union army at age 75.  11/01/1861: McClellan named commander Following General Scott's retirement, President Lincoln names George McClellan, a West Point graduate, as new commander of the Union army. McClellan proves to be an extremely cautious general. His inability to win decisive battles will frustrate Lincoln, who will eventually replace him.  02/20/1862: William Wallace (Willie) Lincoln dies William Wallace (Willie) Lincoln dies from typhoid fever. He is the second son the Lincolns have lost.  03/09/1862: Ironclad warfare The first duel between two ironclad warships occurs. With trade suffering from the federal blockade, the Confederacy converts the wooden Merrimack into an ironclad gunship, now called the Virginia . The Union Monitor battles the Virginia to a standoff. In May, the Union forces the Confederacy to abandon Norfolk, definitively establishing the Union's naval superiority.  04/16/1862: Slavery abolished in D.C. Slavery is abolished in District of Columbia.  06/01/1862: General Robert E. Lee appointed commander General Robert E. Lee is appointed commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia after his predecessor is wounded.  07/1862: Organizing black troops Major General David Hunter of the Union organizes the first black troops, among whom number many former slaves. By war's end, nearly 200,000 African Americans will have served in the Union forces, comprising roughly ten percent of the Union's total manpower. Initially, the Confederacy threatens to execute every captured black soldier; Lincoln responds by promising to execute one Confederate soldier for each black killed.  07/22/1862: Lincoln's intentions Lincoln announces to his cabinet his intention to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. By this point, he believes the border states will remain in the Union. Lincoln decides to wait to address the nation publicly, however, hoping to introduce his proclamation after a more favorable military battle.  08/29/1862: Second Battle of Bull Run The Second Battle of Bull Run takes place. Generals Stonewall Jackson and Lee prove too much for the Union troops under General John Pope, who retreat to Washington, D.C. The battle leads to huge Union losses.  09/17/1862: Battle of Antietam Creek The Battle of Antietam Creek near Sharpsburg, Maryland, occurs, and becomes the bloodiest one-day engagement of the Civil War. General Lee invades the North in an attempt to isolate Washington, D.C., but finds himself thwarted by General McClellan and the Union forces. The Union is aided by a copy of Lee's orders, left by a Confederate soldier at a campsite. In the carnage that follows, nearly 5,000 men are killed and 18,000 wounded. McClellan fails to follow Lee's retreat, and a frustrated Lincoln consequently removes him from his command.  09/22/1862: Emancipation Proclamation Following the Confederate defeat at Antietam, Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, to go into effect on January 1, 1863. In the document, Lincoln frees all slaves in Confederate or contested areas of the South. Slaves in non-Confederate border states and in parts of the Confederacy under Union control are not included. European public opinion sides with Lincoln and the Union.  11/1862: Midterm congressional elections Midterm congressional elections take place. The Republicans maintain control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with a 39-12 majority in Senate and a 103-80 majority in the House.  12/13/1862: Battle of Fredericksburg The Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, marks a grave defeat for the Union. General Lee and his Confederate troops defeat General Burnside. Union losses number more than 12,600, while Confederate casualties rise to 5,300.  12/31/1862: The Union ironclad Monitor sinks The Union ironclad Monitor (now Virginia ) sinks off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.  01/01/1863: Emancipation Proclamation goes into effect  On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. With it, he freed all slaves in Confederate or contested areas of the South. However, the Proclamation did not include slaves in non-Confederate border states and in parts of the Confederacy under Union control.  During the war, Republicans and Northern free blacks called on the President to act decisively to end slavery. Members of the Lincoln administration also hoped that an act of emancipation would make it difficult for Britain or France to officially recognize the Confederacy in view of the antislavery sentiments among their home populations–especially in Britain. In July 1862, President Lincoln announced to his cabinet that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation in his capacity as Commander in Chief of the armed forces in the time of war. The Proclamation would free all slaves in areas still in rebellion, and henceforth it would be a Union objective to destroy slavery within the Confederate South. His cabinet persuaded Lincoln to wait until a Union victory, lest it appear to the world like an act of desperation.  After General George McClellan stopped Robert E. Lee's advance into Maryland at Antietam Creek in September 1862, Lincoln announced his preliminary Proclamation. The President warned that if the rebellion did not end by January 1, 1863, he would issue his presidential order of emancipation and move to destroy slavery in the rebel states once and for all. In the Proclamation, Lincoln left out occupied Tennessee and certain occupied parts of Louisiana and Virginia as well as the loyal slave states. The document declared, with the exception of those areas, that all slaves in the rebellious states were hereafter “forever free.” It also asserted that the Union Army would now receive black men into the service as regular soldiers. (The U.S. Navy had accepted black sailors from the beginning of the war.)  In a single stroke of his pen, Abraham Lincoln issued the most revolutionary measure ever to come from an American President up to that time. Still, the President was worried that the courts might void his wartime Proclamation after the war on the grounds that any confiscation of “property” required due process of law, and that such a policy could only be adopted by a law passed by Congress. Thus, Lincoln used his reelection victory in 1864 to promote a constitutional amendment that would end slavery everywhere in the nation. The Republican platform of 1864 endorsed the Thirteenth Amendment–which the U.S. Senate had passed in April. Lincoln used all the powers of his office, including patronage, to push it through the House, which adopted the amendment on January 31, 1865. The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified in December 1865.  Read the full text of the Emancipation Proclamation .  01/02/1863: Battle of Murfreesboro The Battle of Murfreesboro occurs.  02/24/1863: Territory of Arizona formed The territory of Arizona is formed from the Territory of New Mexico.  02/25/1863: National Banking Act The National Banking Act, designed by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, creates the system for a national bank. To supervise, Congress creates the “controller of the currency” position, which is first given to Hugh McCulloch on May 9, 1863.  3/03/1863: Conscription law Congress passes a conscription law, requiring military service. For $300, a draftee can hire a substitute; this addendum angers some who claim it is “aristocracy legislation.”  05/01/1863: Battle of Chancellorsville Near the District of Columbia, in Virginia, the Battle of Chancellorsville takes place. General Lee wins a brilliant victory over Union General Joseph Hooker. Following his success, Lee decides to begin a second invasion into the North.  05/02/1863: General Stonewall Jackson wounded General Stonewall Jackson is wounded in the Battle of Chancellorsville, accidentally shot by his own troops; his left arm must be amputated. Jackson catches pneumonia and dies on May 10.  05/03/1863: Territory of Idaho created The Territory of Idaho is created from existing territories. This territory later includes the states of Montana and Wyoming.  06/20/1863: West Virginia becomes a state West Virginia is admitted to Union as the thirty-fifth state.  07/01/1863: Battle of Gettysburg The Battle of Gettysburg, the war's greatest engagement, occurs. In his invasion of the North, Lee makes a bid to smash through Union forces and take Washington, D.C., from the west with 75,000 troops. General George E. Meade, who replaced McClellan, meets him accidentally at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. After two days of battle, Lee makes his greatest blunder and sends General George Picket and 15,000 men on a suicidal charge across Cemetery Ridge. By July 4, both sides are exhausted; the following day, Lee's troops retreat across the Potomac, never to return to the North. The South suffers greatly with nearly 30,000 killed, wounded, or missing; the North endures 23,000 casualties. For the remainder of the war, Lee will fight on the defensive. Meanwhile, Meade fails to pursue the retreating Confederate troops, frustrating Lincoln.  07/04/1863: Vicksburg captured After an engagement of months, General Ulysses S. Grant finally captures Vicksburg, Mississippi, a Confederate stronghold. Using the tactics of “total war,” Grant feeds his troops on Southern crops and starves Vicksburg and its defenders into submission. Capturing Vicksburg gives the Union control over the entirety of Mississippi. Shortly thereafter, Lincoln appoints Grant his lieutenant general, announcing, “Grant is my man, and I am his the rest of the war.”  07/13/1863: Rioters protest the conscription act Angry over the draft, rioters in New York City protest the conscription act. More than one-hundred people, many of them African-American, are killed. Lincoln has units from Gettysburg rush to the city to end the fighting.  11/19/1863: Gettysburg Address Lincoln makes his famous Gettysburg Address -- consisting of three short paragraphs -- on the bloodstained battlefield. Ceremonies take place which include the dedication of a national cemetery.  12/08/1863: Lincoln offers full pardons Lincoln offers a full pardon to Southerners who take the prescribed oath.  05/07/1864: Spotsylvania campaign General Grant continues his Spotsylvania campaign, hammering through Lee's forces.  06/07/1864: RNC nominates Lincoln again The Republican National Convention nominates President Lincoln for second term. Andrew Johnson is nominated as his new vice president.  07/05/1864: Horace Greeley negotiations Horace Greeley, a radical Republican, is eager for peace. Lincoln opens peace negotiations and tells Greeley that emissaries from Jefferson Davis are in Canada. Without proper authority, however, negotiations at Niagara Falls, New York, fail.  08/29/1864: DNC nominates McClellan The Democratic National Convention nominates General George B. McClellan, the former Union commander, for the presidency and George Pendleton for the vice-presidency. Claiming the war effort a failure, the Democrats support a ceasefire and peace conference.  09/01/1864: Confederates evacuate Atlanta Confederates under General John Hood evacuate from Atlanta, Georgia. The next day, Union forces led by General William Tecumseh Sherman occupy the city. Grant's colleague, Sherman will continue his run through Georgia, utilizing the tactics of “total warfare.”  10/31/1864: Nevada becomes a state Nevada is admitted to the Union as the thirty-sixth state.  11/1864: Republicans increase their power In congressional elections, the Republicans increase their power in both houses. They now hold majorities of 42-10 in the Senate and 149-42 in the House.  11/08/1864: Lincoln reelected Following decisive Union victories by Admiral Farragut in Alabama and General Sherman in Atlanta, Abraham Lincoln is reelected as President of the United States, with Andrew Johnson as his vice president. Along with 55 percent of the popular vote, Lincoln wins 212 electoral votes to McClellan's 21.  11/16/1864: Sherman begins his march After burning Atlanta, General Sherman begins his notorious 300-mile march to the sea with 62,000 men. Traveling roughly ten miles a day, the Union troops ravage the countryside, leaving a path of destruction fifty miles wide; they capture Savannah in late December. Sherman then turns toward South Carolina.  12/15/1864: Salmon P. Chase appointed Salmon P. Chase is appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Formerly Governor of Ohio and then secretary of the treasury under Lincoln, Chase kept the nation out of financial ruin through Legal Tender Act in 1862. With this legislation, Chase issued 150 million “greenbacks” (paper money), ordering that “In God We Trust” be printed on them to encourage people to accept the money at face value. Chase had also orchestrated the first income tax in 1863.  01/31/1865: Thirteenth Amendment With Lincoln's influence, the House of Representatives approves the Thirteenth Amendment, which calls for the emancipation of all slaves and no compensation to their owners. The amendment was passed by the Senate in 1864 but failed to receive the necessary votes in the House. By December of 1865, enough states ratify the amendment to make it constitutionally binding.  House Passes Thirteenth Amendment  On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the Thirteenth Amendment, which made slavery illegal in the United States. The Senate had passed the amendment in April 1864. With Congress's approval, the amendment then went to the states for ratification. By December 1865, enough states had ratified the amendment to make it constitutionally binding.  The Thirteenth Amendment had two sections. Section one read: “Neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Section two stated that Congress had the power to pass legislation to enforce the abolition of slavery.  Prior to becoming president, Abraham Lincoln had compromised on the slavery issue in the political arena. Although Lincoln clearly hated slavery, he assumed the presidency promising not to interfere with it. During the American Civil War, President Lincoln noted again and again that his purpose in fighting the South was to save the Union, not to free the slaves. But as the war dragged on and more and more slaves from the South fled to the Union Army, Lincoln began to reconsider slavery, and he came under more and more pressure to free the slaves.  In July 1862, the president announced to his cabinet that he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces in time of war. The Proclamation would free all slaves in areas still in rebellion, and henceforth it would be a Union objective to destroy slavery within the Confederate South. After the Union Army defeated the Confederates at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation and warned that if the war did not end by January 1, 1863, the Emancipation would go into effect and the Union would move to destroy slavery in the rebel states forever.  During his reelection campaign of 1864, President Lincoln promoted a constitutional amendment that would end slavery throughout the country. Lincoln used all the powers of his office to have Congress pass the amendment. Lincoln, however, did not live to see the Thirteenth Amendment become part of the Constitution. The president was assassinated in April 1865, and the amendment was ratified in December of that year.  02/06/1865: Robert E. Lee given overall command The Confederate Congress in Richmond gives Robert E. Lee overall command of the Confederate armies. Previously, President Jefferson Davis had served as commander.  3/03/1865:Freedman's Bureau created Congress creates the Freedmen's Bureau to help Southern blacks affected by the war. The Bureau supplies blacks with food, clothing, and medical care, and will orchestrate the placement of freedmen on abandoned lands.  03/04/1865: Abraham Lincoln inaugurated Abraham Lincoln is inaugurated as president for his second term while Andrew Johnson succeeds Hannibal Hamlin as vice-president.  03/13/1865: Confederates recruit slaves Desperate for manpower, the Confederate Congress approves the recruitment of 300,000 slaves for military involvement. Jefferson Davis declares that all volunteers and their families will be given freedom.  04/03/1865: Richmond is evacuated  04/09/1865: Surrender at Appomattox After Union forces capture much-needed Confederate supplies at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrenders to General Grant, marking the end of the Civil War.  04/14/1865: Lincoln shot Actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth shoots President Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., at around 10:15 p.m.  04/15/1865: Abraham Lincoln dies Abraham Lincoln dies at 7:22 a.m. in the home of William Petersen. Vice President Andrew Johnson is sworn in as the seventeenth President of the United States.  President Abraham Lincoln Dies  On April 15, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln died. He had been shot by an assassin the night before and died of a head wound early on the morning of the 15th.  President Lincoln had been sworn in to his second term of office on March 4, 1865. On April 9, he oversaw the end of the American Civil War when the Confederate Army surrendered to the Union. It had been a remarkable spring for the commander in chief.  On April 14, Lincoln sat in Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., watching a play when a man burst into the presidential box and shot the President in the back of his head. The assassin, John Wilkes Booth, leaped from the box to the stage to make his escape, shouting “Sic semper Tyrannis! (Thus always to Tyrants) The South is avenged!”  The President died at 7:22 a.m. the next morning in the home of William Petersen. A few hours after Lincoln's death, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase swore Vice President Andrew Johnson in as President of the United States.  The assassin, Booth, was an actor and an ardent Confederate sympathizer who had planned to kill Lincoln along with accomplices who were supposed to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and General Ulysses S. Grant. However, the plan went array, and only Booth carried out his part of the plan. Four of his co-conspirators were convicted and hanged for taking part in the plot or for having known about it in advance. Booth was discovered in a barn in rural Virginia ten days after Lincoln's assassination after frantic searching by the Army and the Secret Service. As they attempted to capture Booth, the barn was set on fire, and Booth either shot himself or was killed in a shoot-out.  Lincoln's death stunned the country and muted its joy over the end of the Civil War. After seven days of official mourning in the Capitol, Lincoln's coffin was carried on a slow-moving funeral train back to Springfield, Illinois. As the procession traveled through the country, people in small towns and villages, in big cities, and throughout the countryside gathered to see the train pass and offer their last respects to Lincoln. Thousands of Americans remembered the sight of the passing funeral train as one of the most deeply emotional events of their lives.

It was indeed glorious, all Washington was in the streets,” wrote Benjamin Brown French, commissioner of public buildings in Washington, D.C. To celebrate the event, French “had the 23rd verse of the 118th Psalm printed on cloth, in enormous letters, as a transparency, and stretched on a frame the entire length of the top of the western portico, . . . ‘This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.’” A week later, after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, crowds of Washingtonians again took to the streets in jubilation. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton ordered that guns be fired in salute to commemorate the day.  The euphoria of Union victory came to a sudden halt on the night of April 14, 1865, when President Lincoln was shot while attending a play at Ford’s Theatre. As the president lay dying in a house across the street from the theater, Senator Charles Sumner appeared at his bedside. Keeping his deathbed vigil throughout the long night, the Massachusetts senator was one of the few present when Lincoln died on the morning of April 15. “Mourn not the dead,” Sumner later wrote in his eulogy to Lincoln, “but rejoice in his life and example . . . . Rejoice that through him Emancipation was proclaimed.” Having just days before taken to the streets in joyful celebration, Washingtonians now solemnly lined Pennsylvania Avenue as the massive funeral procession made its way to the Capitol. In the Rotunda, the body of the martyred president lay in state upon a hastily constructed catafalque . Reporter Benjamin Perley Poore described the dramatic scene:   The procession was two hours and ten minutes in passing a given point, and was about three miles long. The centre of it had reached the Capitol and was returning before the rear had left Willard’s [Hotel]. In one single detachment were over six thousand civil employees of the Government. Arriving at the Capitol, the remains were placed in the centre of the rotunda, beneath the mighty dome, which had been draped in mourning inside and out.   The death of the president muted the celebrations of Union victory. “It seems even yet a frightful dream, rather than a reality,” said Senator James Dixon of Connecticut, “in the hour when his wisdom and his patriotism were about to be crowned with the success they deserved.” With the prospects for peace finally at hand, Dixon thought it especially tragic that Lincoln, “the humane, the forgiving, the patient, the forbearing, has been stricken down by the hand of an assassin. That voice is silent.” The Capitol was still draped in mourning in late May when Washingtonians witnessed the Grand Review of the Union armies. The Senate doorkeeper, Isaac Bassett , captured these emotional two days in his diary:   No nation ever looked on such a triumphal procession as railed through the 150,000 strong and twenty miles at least in length. The soldiers were returning from the longest marches, the severest exposures which any armies in modern times have passed through, their tattered banners told the tale of their prolonged hardships. This was no holiday parade of soldiers. Here were our fellow citizens who had for four long woeful years left home and all that makes home dear and risked all. Sacrificed for law and liberties for us and our children. . . . As far as the eye could see up Pennsylvania Avenue seemed like a river of life. . . . There were the old banners first blessed at home and consecrated with the prayers of wives and mothers. Now shorn to shreds, scarce able to cling to the flagstaff. How glad they seem to be—their work well done, their homes secure, their nation saved.        div PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"     People      Officers & Staff    Party Leadership    Senators    Featured Biographies      Institution      Origins & Development    Powers & Procedures    Chronology    Party Division      Senate Stories      1787-1800    1801-1850    1851-1877    1878-1920    1921-1940    1941-1963    1964-present      Oral History Project      List of Interviews      Special Features    Paintings    Sculpture    Prints, Drawings & Photographs    Furniture & Decorative Art    Ephemera & Historical Objects        Senate Historical Office   Information provided by the Senate Historical Office .
